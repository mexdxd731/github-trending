Omakade is a fast, local-first game library built for Omarchy. It brings
installed Steam, Lutris, Heroic, Faugus, RetroArch, Epic, GOG, and Amazon games
into one quiet, cover-focused home that follows the active Omarchy theme.

- Runtime source controls with scan status and detected locations
- Optional close-after-launch behavior
- Collections, tags, completion states, and smart organization filters
- Local Steam achievements plus optional Web API enrichment

Omakade reads launcher data without modifying it. Core discovery, browsing,
artwork, and launching work offline. Run `omakade --demo` to explore the UI
with a deterministic fictional library.

## Install on Omarchy or Arch

### Install or upgrade from the terminal

These commands download Omakade and its checksum into the current directory,
verify the package, and install it. If Omakade is already installed, `pacman -U`
upgrades it in place without removing your settings or library data:

```bash
curl -fLO https://github.com/tsouth89/omakade/releases/download/v1.2.3/omakade-1.2.3-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
curl -fLO https://github.com/tsouth89/omakade/releases/download/v1.2.3/SHA256SUMS
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
sudo pacman -U ./omakade-1.2.3-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
```

### Install or upgrade from a browser download

1. Open the [latest release](https://github.com/tsouth89/omakade/releases/latest).
2. Under **Assets**, download `omakade-1.2.3-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst` and
   `SHA256SUMS` into the same folder.
3. Open a terminal in that folder and run:

```bash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
sudo pacman -U ./omakade-1.2.3-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
```

Launch Omakade from the application launcher or run `omakade` in a terminal.

Omakade keeps its local library and settings when the package is upgraded or
removed. The owning launchers remain responsible for games, accounts, updates,
cloud saves, DRM, and compatibility tools.

RetroArch games come from its configured playlists. Omakade uses local
RetroArch thumbnails and runtime logs, then launches each game with its assigned
core. Entries without a core association remain visible and explain how to fix
launching after you press Play.

## Build

Requirements:

- CMake 3.24 or newer
- Ninja
- C++20 compiler
- Qt 6.8 or newer with Concurrent, Core, Gui, Network, Qml, Quick, Quick
  Controls, SQL, and Test
- SDL 3
- libsecret

```bash
cmake --preset dev
cmake --build --preset dev
ctest --preset dev
./build/dev/omakade
```

Use `Ctrl+F` to search, arrow keys to navigate, Enter to open details, Escape
to return, and F11 to toggle fullscreen. `Ctrl+M` toggles reduced motion and
`Ctrl+D` opens settings and source diagnostics.

## Local data

- Library: `~/.local/share/omakade/library.sqlite3`
- Settings: `~/.config/omakade/config.toml`
- Downloaded artwork: `~/.cache/omakade/`
- Selected custom covers: `~/.local/share/omakade/artwork/`

Core library discovery, local achievements, artwork, search, organization,
controller navigation, and launching require no Steam API key or network
connection. Optional Steam and IGDB credentials are stored by Secret Service,
and cached game insights stay available offline.

[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for release notes, and the current
[compatibility report](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md) for tested platform layouts.
