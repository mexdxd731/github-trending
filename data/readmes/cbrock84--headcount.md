An agent organization for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), structured as a company:
a chief executive over 16 departments, 146 skills in total.

Every department is an independently installable plugin, so a project loads only the functions it
needs rather than all of them at once.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add cbrock84/headcount
/plugin install security@headcount
```

Install as many departments as the project needs. Skills are addressed as `department:skill` —
`security:threat-modeling`, `finance:unit-economics` — so names never collide.

## Use

Skills load themselves when a request matches. Ask a question in the department's territory and the
right specialist engages:

| You ask | What loads |
|---|---|
| "why isn't this landing page converting?" | `demand-generation:landing-page-cro-expert` |
| "review this design before we build it" | `security:threat-modeling` |
| "can we afford this hire?" | `finance:unit-economics` |
| "our growth has stalled" | `executive:business-growth-consultant` |

Invoke one directly by name when you want a specific lens: `/finance:financial-modeling`.

Seven situations that cross departments — a SOC 2 demand from an enterprise prospect, a
security incident, a stalled funnel — are worked through end to end in
[docs/USE-CASES.md](docs/USE-CASES.md), including where a reviewer-class department stops the
work rather than adding an opinion.

Each department also ships an agent charter in `.claude/agents/`, so a department can be delegated
to as a subagent with its own exclusive write surface.

**Reviewer-class departments** (`security`, `legal-risk`) review what other departments build, and
their blocking findings are not overrulable by the department under review. That is why the CISO
and the CLO report to the chief executive rather than into the function they oversee.

## How it is organized

```
plugins/<department>/
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json   department manifest
  skills/<skill>/SKILL.md      frontmatter name equals the directory name
.claude/agents/<id>.md         one charter per department
docs/AGENT-SURFACES.md         every path has exactly one owner, enforced in CI
docs/DECISION-LOG.md           numbered decisions with options and recommendations
docs/USE-CASES.md              situations worked end to end across departments
docs/org-chart.html           interactive org chart, searchable across every skill
docs/index.html               GitHub Pages entry point, redirects to the chart
```

Agents split by **exclusive write surface**, not by topic — a topic split has no checkable
boundary, and two agents working on "SEO" and "UI" both end up in the same file. See
`executive:agent-hierarchy` for the method.

## Contributing

```
./scripts/check-all.sh
```

Verifies the surface map is coherent, every skill's frontmatter is valid and unique, no
third-party license text has appeared, the generated README and social card are current, every
`department:skill` reference in the docs resolves, spelling is US English, and every manifest
parses. CI runs the same
script, so local and CI cannot drift.

A new department needs its roster row in `docs/AGENT-SURFACES.md`, a surface block, a charter in
`.claude/agents/`, and an entry in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — all in the same change, or
the check fails.
