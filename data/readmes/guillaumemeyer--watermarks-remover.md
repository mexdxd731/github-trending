[![CI](https://github.com/guillaumemeyer/watermarks-remover/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/guillaumemeyer/watermarks-remover/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/guillaumemeyer/watermarks-remover)](https://github.com/guillaumemeyer/watermarks-remover/releases)

Agent skill + stdlib Python scripts to strip **multi-vendor AI provenance marks** from text and files — for privacy and hygiene on content **you own**.

| Layer | Target | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A** | Invisible Unicode, exotic spaces, bidi, tag chars | Deterministic Python scripts |
| **B** | Statistical (token-sampling) text watermarks | Agent rewrite + optional `rewrite_text.py` hook |
| **Files** | C2PA / EXIF / XMP / doc props | PNG, JPEG, SVG, PDF, DOCX, ODT, HTML, Markdown |

Vendors / ecosystems (class-level): **Claude**, **Gemini / SynthID-Text**, **OpenAI** provenance surfaces, **open-LLM** Kirchenbauer-style marks.

**Latest release:** [v0.2.0](https://github.com/guillaumemeyer/watermarks-remover/releases/tag/v0.2.0)

Skill path: [`skills/remove-ai-marks/`](skills/remove-ai-marks/)  
(migration: formerly `remove-claude-marks`; slash alias `/remove-claude-marks` still documented)

## Install (agent skill)

```bash
# Grok Build / project-local
mkdir -p .grok/skills
ln -sfn "$(pwd)/skills/remove-ai-marks" .grok/skills/remove-ai-marks

# User-global Grok
mkdir -p ~/.grok/skills
ln -sfn "$(pwd)/skills/remove-ai-marks" ~/.grok/skills/remove-ai-marks
```

Invoke with `/remove-ai-marks` or ask to “strip AI watermarks / C2PA / Claude marks / SynthID-class text.”

Optional system tools (auto-used when present):

| Tool | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [`c2patool`](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs/tree/main/cli) | Inspect C2PA manifests |
| [`exiftool`](https://exiftool.org/) | Residual metadata strip (esp. **PDF**) |

Core scripts need **Python 3.10+** stdlib only. Layer B model calls are optional.

## How text marking works (short)

Modern LLM watermarks often hide a signal in **which tokens are chosen** (generative / sampling bias), not only in invisible characters. Edit-based schemes inject Unicode or synonym rules. File schemes attach **C2PA** or generator metadata.

- **Layer A** removes edit-based Unicode carriers (testable).
- **Layer B** attacks sampling watermarks via heavy rewrite (best-effort; literature-standard attacks such as paraphrase / back-translation).
- **File cleaners** strip C2PA/XMP/props from supported containers.

Until vendors ship public detectors and keys, **no tool can honestly certify** “this fails the official check.” Reports must separate verifiable vs best-effort work.

Prefer a **non-origin** model for Layer B (do not rewrite Claude text with Claude if you are trying to avoid re-stamping).

---

## Disclaimer: what removing a text watermark costs

Text watermarks live in **the wording itself**: the signal is spread across token choices, so nearly every sentence carries a little of it. Two consequences follow, and they are why Layer B is honestly described as *best-effort* rather than a magic eraser.

1. **Removal means rewording, not restructuring.** Shuffling paragraphs, changing headings, or light touch-ups barely move the signal. Stripping a statistical mark requires rewriting a substantial fraction of the text — sentence by sentence, not section by section.

2. **Rewording degrades the copy.** Any rewrite replaces the original word choices with the rewriting model's, which flattens tone, voice, and precision. On production copy (SEO, marketing, client work) that degradation is real and often visible to the people who care most about the writing. It is like taking text from a top-tier model and asking a less capable model to rewrite it from scratch: the result cannot exceed the rewrite model's ceiling.

Which leads to the honest full-circle question:

> If the plan is to rewrite the text with a cheaper model anyway, why pay for a premium model in the first place? Generating directly with the cheaper model is simpler, cheaper, and produces the same — or better — end result.

Layer B makes sense when you specifically want the premium model's **thinking and drafting** and accept a rewrite pass to satisfy a hygiene or privacy requirement — not as a cheap route to mark-free text.

**When to skip Layer B:**

- **Quality matters more than hygiene:** use the lossless path — Layer A Unicode scrub plus the file metadata cleaners — and keep the original prose.
- **Rewriting anyway:** use a **non-origin** model (rewriting with the origin model can re-stamp the text), and remember residual risk remains — no tool can certify a vendor detector will fail.

## File formats

| Format | Inspect | Clean |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PNG / JPEG | C2PA chunks / APP11, AI XMP hints | Drop metadata segments |
| SVG | `<metadata>`, XMP | Strip blocks |
| PDF | Byte/XMP + optional tools | **exiftool** preferred; degraded without it |
| DOCX | docProps / customXml | Scrub props, drop customXml |
| ODT | meta.xml | Drop generator / AI-ish meta |
| HTML | meta, JSON-LD, data-ai* | Strip tags/attrs |
| Markdown | YAML frontmatter AI keys | Drop keys + Layer A body |

Pixel-domain watermarks and **C2PA soft binding** (in-content watermark that can re-link a remote Content Credentials manifest after metadata is stripped) remain **out of scope**. Stripping hard-bound C2PA does **not** clear those channels.

### Residual risk after a clean

This tool reports **verifiable** removals (Unicode counts, metadata actions) and **best-effort** Layer B rewrites. It cannot certify that vendor detectors will fail.

To check residual signals yourself (optional, external):

| Channel | What we remove | What may remain | External check (examples) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hard-bound C2PA / EXIF / XMP | Yes | Soft-bound / pixel marks | [c2patool](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs/tree/main/cli), [Content Credentials verify](https://contentcredentials.org/verify) |
| SynthID-class media | No | Pixel/audio/video watermark | Provider tools (e.g. [Google SynthID](https://deepmind.google/science/synthid/) / Vertex detector where offered) |
| Statistical text | Best-effort rewrite | Strong marks after light edit | No public universal detector; vendor tools when available |

## Changelog

### [v0.2.0](https://github.com/guillaumemeyer/watermarks-remover/releases/tag/v0.2.0) — c2patool false-positive fix

- `image_meta.py`: `has_manifest` no longer flags `Error: No claim found` / `No JUMBF data found` as a manifest (operator-precedence bug: the negative markers now veto every positive branch)
- New `tests/test_c2patool_report.py` (4 cases: no claim, no JUMBF, genuine manifest, tool absent)
- Docs: fixed `c2patool` links (repo moved to `contentauth/c2pa-rs`); added a disclaimer on the quality cost of text-watermark removal

### [v0.1.0](https://github.com/guillaumemeyer/watermarks-remover/releases/tag/v0.1.0) — packaging polish + provenance honesty

- `Makefile` (`test` / `smoke` / `install-skill`) and `pytest.ini`
- Fixture samples for Markdown, HTML, SVG; PDF degraded-clean test
- Docs: industry **two-layer** model (hard-bound C2PA vs soft binding / SynthID-media)
- README residual-risk table + links to external verify tools
- Reference: Institute of AI PM C2PA/SynthID guide
- Soft-binding and pixel/audio/video watermarks explicitly out of scope in skill/matrix/ethics

### [v0.0.1](https://github.com/guillaumemeyer/watermarks-remover/releases/tag/v0.0.1) — initial multi-vendor release

- Agent skill `remove-ai-marks` (replaces Claude-only `remove-claude-marks`)
- **Layer A:** invisible Unicode / bidi / tag chars / space homoglyphs (`inspect_text` / `clean_text`)
- **Layer B:** rewrite guidance + optional `rewrite_text.py` (print-prompt, Ollama, OpenAI-compatible)
- **Files:** C2PA/AI metadata strip for PNG, JPEG, SVG, PDF, DOCX, ODT, HTML, Markdown
- Unified `inspect_file.py` / `clean_file.py`
- Multi-vendor docs (Claude, Gemini/SynthID-class, OpenAI, open-LLM)
- Stdlib-first scripts; optional `c2patool` / `exiftool`
