**[humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer), but for code.** An agent skill that removes signs of AI-generated code from a repository — the structural slop coding agents leave behind when they optimize for "tests pass" instead of "codebase stays healthy."

The prose humanizer catalogs AI *writing* tells (em-dashes, "it's not just X, it's Y", rule-of-three). This catalogs AI *coding* tells — 16 numbered patterns in 5 tiers, each with detection signals and before/after examples in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md):

### The patterns

**Tier 1 — Duplication and reinvention**

| # | Pattern | The tell |
|---|---------|----------|
| 1 | **Reimplementing an existing helper** *(the signature tell)* | a new private function that duplicates something in `utils`/a sibling module — agents write from the prompt outward, not from the repo inward |
| 2 | **`_v2` / `_new` / `_impl` clones** | `foo` and `foo_v2` both alive; the agent didn't dare modify the original, so now there are two sources of truth |
| 3 | **Reinventing stdlib / installed deps** | hand-rolled `groupby`, deep-copy-via-JSON, manual URL parsing |

**Tier 2 — Speculative architecture**

| # | Pattern | The tell |
|---|---------|----------|
| 4 | **Single-implementation abstraction** | an ABC / registry / "pluggable backend" with exactly one implementation, one registration, one call site |
| 5 | **Dead "for future use" code** | helpers with no call site; docstrings saying *flexible, extensible, seamlessly* |
| 6 | **Wrapper that adds nothing** | a function whose body is one same-argument call |
| 7 | **Config/API sprawl for a local case** | a new global flag or public parameter consulted from exactly one place |

**Tier 3 — Defensive slop**

| # | Pattern | The tell |
|---|---------|----------|
| 8 | **Broad exception swallowing** | `except Exception: return ""` — crashes (visible, debuggable) converted into corruption (invisible) |
| 9 | **Unjustified try-import fallback** | `try: import ujson except ImportError: import json` with no benchmark, no extras entry, no fallback test |
| 10 | **Attribute-probing chains** | `hasattr`/`getattr`/`isinstance` ladders accepting "dict or object or maybe None" |
| 11 | **Paranoid re-validation** | `if x is not None` on values that were just constructed |

**Tier 4 — Noise**

| # | Pattern | The tell |
|---|---------|----------|
| 12 | **Narrating comments** | the comment restates the next line (`# Join the rows with newlines`) |
| 13 | **Boilerplate docstrings** | the docstring is the function name with spaces; *robust, comprehensive, seamless* |
| 14 | **Dead imports, unused variables, banners** | leftovers from deleted attempts; `# ===== SECTION =====`; stray debug prints |

**Tier 5 — Test slop** *(report-only by default)*

| # | Pattern | The tell |
|---|---------|----------|
| 15 | **Tests that assert the mock** | every collaborator mocked; the test can never fail for a real reason |
| 16 | **Trivial or duplicated assertions** | asserting literals; the same case re-tested under three names |

Every finding gets a severity 0–4, where **1 = present but justified → exempt**: fallbacks with documented reasons, defensive code at trust boundaries, plugin registries, migration-period `_v2`s stay untouched. The catalog is half the skill — the other half matters more:

## Why it's not just a pattern list

Modern agents already *recognize* most slop when pointed at a file. Where they fail is discipline. In our baseline test, an agent without this skill cleaned a slop file nicely — and **silently changed a public error type along the way** (swapped an `AttributeError` for a "nicer" `ValueError`), in one un-reviewable mega-change, editing before ever running the tests.

So the skill's core is three iron rules the catalog hangs off:

1. **Behavior preservation is absolute** — including error types and timing. Latent bugs get *reported*, never silently "improved."
2. **No tests → no edits.** The test suite is the oracle for "meaning-preserving." Missing oracle = report-only mode.
3. **One pattern-class per commit**, suite run after each, behavior-risk changes isolated in `[BEHAVIOR]`-labeled commits.

Plus a **false-positive guard**: severity 1 = "present but justified" (fallbacks with documented reasons, defensive code at trust boundaries, plugin registries, migration-period `_v2`s) — those are exempt. The goal is a healthier repo, not a body count.

## Real-world run

First field test: a private ML research repo, 13.4k LOC of Python (21-module package + 36 experiment scripts + 20 test files), written largely by coding agents under human review. Scan mode, zero edits, `git status` clean before and after.

**24 findings — and a sharp profile.** Defensive slop (broad excepts, try-import fallbacks, probing chains, narrating comments): **zero**. Test slop: **zero across all 20 test files**. The debt was almost entirely **Tier-1 duplication** (11 findings, 40+ pasted instances), and the copies were already biting:

- a provenance helper pasted into **20 of 22 run scripts had already drifted** — 3 copies gained an env-var fallback the other 17 lack;
- an experiment class copy-pasted into a "learned" variant whose metric method **silently diverged** — one copy checks 3 intervention pairs, the other 1;
- the same orthogonal-matrix sampler pasted 4×, the same query dataclass pasted verbatim across modules.

4 findings were exempted as justified (severity 1): a preregistration guard, a deliberate sampling-strategy comparison, bounded retries with a final `raise`. 8 of 36 scripts and 6 of 21 modules came back fully clean — and were reported as clean.

The take-away matched the skill's premise: agents working under review don't swallow errors — they **rewrite what already exists**. Repo-context duplication detection is the tier that matters.

## Install

Copy (or clone) this directory into your agent's skills folder:

```bash
# Claude Code
git clone https://github.com/LeonardNJU/code-humanizer ~/.claude/skills/code-humanizer
```

Any harness that reads `SKILL.md` agent skills works the same way — the skill is a single Markdown file, no build step, no dependencies.

## Use

```
> use code-humanizer to scan this PR
> deslop pkg/report.py — you have my approval to fix
> this repo was vibe-coded, humanize it (report first)
```

Default mode is **scan → report** (findings table with pattern #, severity 0–4, evidence, proposed fix, behavior risk). Fix mode runs on your approval, one pattern per commit, tests green after every step.

## Scope honesty

- Examples are Python; the patterns and workflow are language-agnostic (signals sections mention Python idioms — port as needed).
- This removes *structural* debt, not formatting opinions — that's your linter's job.
- Judgment-heavy debt (root-cause-vs-workaround fixes) is reported, not auto-fixed.

## Contributing patterns

The catalog is 16 patterns today and will never be finished — agents keep inventing new kinds of slop. If you've hit one that isn't covered, [open an issue](https://github.com/LeonardNJU/code-humanizer/issues) with a minimal before/after example (or a PR — even better). New patterns enter the catalog the same way the original 16 did: a real failing example first, then the rule.
