## Live Demo

[ZSvirt Live Demo](https://demo.zsvirt.io/) is a free hosted environment for trying ZSvirt online. No local installation is required—after registration and login, you can start exploring the platform right away.

## Architecture

ZSvirt uses a modular architecture built around virtualization resource
management, the management plane, extension services, and operational tooling.

Core capabilities include:

- **Compute virtualization**: host, cluster, virtual machine, image, and
  lifecycle management.
- **Network virtualization**: virtual networks, network services, security
  groups, and related capabilities.
- **Storage virtualization**: primary storage, backup storage, volumes,
  snapshots, and storage resource management.
- **Management plane**: API framework, permission model, events, alarms,
  auditing, and system operations.
- **Extension services**: capabilities for migration, disaster recovery,
  monitoring, quota management, access control, and enterprise operations.
- **Tools and integrations**: installation tools, diagnostics tools, migration
  tools, automation scripts, agents, CLI, and external system integrations.

At the software architecture level, ZSvirt emphasizes asynchrony, statelessness,
extensibility, and automation:

- **Asynchronous architecture**: supports asynchronous messages, asynchronous
  methods, and asynchronous HTTP calls to reduce blocking and improve system
  throughput.
- **Stateless services**: individual requests do not depend on state from other
  requests, making services easier to scale, recover, and operate.
- **Plugin-based extensibility**: supports horizontal extension of resource
  types, business capabilities, and integration capabilities through plugins.
- **Workflow engine**: manages the execution order of complex operations and
  supports rollback and recovery in failure scenarios.
- **Tagging and query capabilities**: supports resource attribute extension,
  resource classification, unified queries, and automation orchestration.
- **Automated deployment**: uses automation tools to handle deployment,
  configuration, and operations tasks, reducing deployment and maintenance
  complexity.

## VMware Migration Guide

As enterprises reassess their virtualization strategies, migration from VMware
to alternative platforms has become an important topic for organizations
seeking cost control, infrastructure flexibility, and long-term operational
stability.

ZSvirt provides migration-oriented capabilities and operational tools to help
users evaluate, plan, and move workloads from existing VMware environments to
ZSvirt-based virtualization infrastructure.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to evaluate ZSvirt is to follow the quick start guide in the
product documentation. It walks you through preparing compute, network, and
storage resources, initializing the management service, and creating your first
virtual machine.

## Governance

ZSvirt is governed by a lightweight open-source governance model that defines
how the project is maintained, how decisions are made, and how contributors
collaborate.

The [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) document is the starting point for learning
about project roles, maintainer responsibilities, decision-making processes,
release management, and community collaboration.

As the community grows, the governance model may evolve to include dedicated
maintainers, working groups, and more formal project processes.
