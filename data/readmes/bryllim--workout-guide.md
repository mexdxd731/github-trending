# Workout Guide

An open exercise illustration library containing 302 exercises, three consistent frames per exercise, a typed framework-neutral npm package, and a searchable static gallery.

The original pose artwork used by this project comes from [Everkinetic](https://github.com/everkinetic/data) under CC BY-SA 4.0. [Bryl Lim](https://bryllim.com) expanded upon that foundation with additional exercises and animation frames, normalized assets, structured metadata, package APIs, and the documentation gallery.

[Browse the gallery](https://bryllim.github.io/workout-guide/) · [Read the guide](https://bryllim.github.io/workout-guide/guide/) · [Open the package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bryllim/workout-guide)

## Install

```sh
npm install @bryllim/workout-guide
```

```ts
import { getExercise, searchExercises, getAssetUrl } from '@bryllim/workout-guide';

const pushUp = getExercise('push-up');
const bodyweightChest = searchExercises('chest', { equipment: 'bodyweight' });
const firstFrame = getAssetUrl('push-up', 1);
```

Direct asset imports and literal React Native `require()` examples are documented in the [integration guide](https://bryllim.github.io/workout-guide/guide/).

## Repository

This npm-workspace monorepo contains:

- `packages/workout-guide`: package API, canonical manifest, and all 906 transparent 512 × 512 PNGs.
- `apps/site`: Astro landing page, gallery, detail pages, and guide.
- `scripts`: deterministic catalog import and validation utilities.

Run the project locally:

```sh
npm install
npm run check
npm run dev
```

The normalized catalog and all package assets are checked into the repository. Maintainers can regenerate them from a compatible source export with `npm run catalog:import -- /path/to/source`.
