Jev chooses, classifies and scores. Your agent supplies the context and does the work.
Use it in an agent loop, or on your own inbox, documents and creative projects.

<a id="install"></a>
## 📦 Install: give this to your agent

Paste this into **Codex, Claude Code or OpenCode**:

```text
Install Jev Skills for my current agent, including the general skill and all scenario skills. Read and follow this installation guide, then verify the installation:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wuyoscar/jev-skill/main/docs/install.md
```

Your agent checks the environment, installs into the current project by default,
and verifies the installation offline. You do not need to run commands yourself;
handle any required approvals. No key? Your agent first asks you to [get one or use agent simulation](#no-key); it never switches silently.
No Vercel account is needed; Node/npm is not required by the default install route.
[Agent installation guide](docs/install.md) · [Manual installation and troubleshooting](docs/installation.md)

<a id="usage"></a>
## 🚀 Installed it? Here is how to use it

**Send one of these prompts to your agent.** Name the skill and the decision you
need; you do not have to write JSON. Use real Jev, or let your current agent
simulate the judgments after you approve that mode.

<a id="no-key"></a>
### 🔑 No key? Choose A or B first

When `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is missing, the agent **must warn you, ask, and wait for your choice**:

> No OpenRouter key was found, so I cannot call Jev. Which option do you prefer?
>
> **A: Get a key.** [Create one](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys), configure it locally, and use real Jev.
>
> **B: Use your current agent.** Simulate classification with the same input, candidates and criteria, without calling Jev.

Mode B labels results `mode: agent_simulation` and `jev_called: false`.
**These are not Jev responses or calibrated Jev probabilities.** Your current
agent's normal usage costs and privacy terms still apply.
For A, configure the key locally, never in chat; real calls incur API usage.
`--dry-run` is separate: it only validates input, with no network or classification.

### Try one example

```text
Use the jev-triage skill and read assets/example.json from its installed folder.
Show its context, questions and candidates. If OPENROUTER_API_KEY is missing, ask:
A: get a key and configure it locally for Jev; B: let the current agent simulate.
Wait for my choice. In API mode, validate with --dry-run, then make one Jev call.
In B mode, judge directly and label the result "Agent simulation; Jev not called".
Do not invent probabilities. Show the complete input, output and mode,
and explain the category and urgency. Do not access my mailbox or execute actions.
```

For an offline format check only, say “only dry-run; no API call or simulated classification”.
If the agent cannot find the skill, have it check the installation location and
reload the session as required by your client.

### Add checkpoints to an agent task

Replace `[TASK]` with your goal, such as “fix CSV parsing and pass the original tests”:

```text
Use the jev skill to support decisions while working on [TASK].
If the key is missing, ask me to choose A (get a key) or B (current-agent simulation).
Use my chosen mode when failures repeat, a route needs choosing, or you are about to claim completion.
Supply the goal, acceptance checks, relevant history, fresh tool results,
existing permissions and the meaning of each candidate action.
Ask for the next step or whether completion is supported; gather missing evidence or ask me.
Act only within my existing authorization and verify the result afterward.
Do not add a Jev call to every trivial step.
```

### Sort your own records in parallel

Replace `[FILE PATH]` with a prepared, redacted file. Agree on the categories with a small sample first:

```text
Use jev-triage to classify feedback in [FILE PATH] as billing, bug, how-to or other.
Keep each record's ID, original text and relevant context. First take 3 records
and let me approve the questions and the data to be sent outside my machine.
If the key is missing, ask me to choose A (get a key) or B (current-agent simulation) and wait.
In API mode, after approval, put each record's classification and urgency in one request;
schedule at most 4 requests in flight. In B mode, judge with the same criteria,
label the results simulated, and do not invent API responses or probabilities.
Process only these 3 records first; do not automatically expand to the whole file.
Return record ID, category, urgency and review status; save inputs, outputs and the mode.
Keep uncertain cases separate. Do not reply to, delete or move any messages.
```

The agent schedules concurrency; the CLI does not start parallel jobs itself.
Check the sample judgments before choosing a larger batch and budget.

### Pick the skill for your task

| I want to… | Ask the agent to use |
|---|---|
| Define a custom decision or agent checkpoint | `jev` |
| Classify and prioritize messages or feedback | `jev-triage` |
| Select source spans and check evidence | `jev-documents` |
| Choose among observed browser or desktop actions | `jev-ui` |
| Recommend a tool, model or specialist | `jev-route` |
| Assess context relevance and compaction timing | `jev-context` |
| Prioritize code changes for review | `jev-code-review` |
| Choose the next location in an observed file inventory | `jev-find-code` |
| Choose legal actions in a simulated world | `jev-simulation` |

To customize a use case, tell the agent **what to judge, the criteria, the options
and how you will use the result**. Use `choice` for one option, `noul` for an
independent yes/no question and `score` for graded levels. Update `state`,
`questions` and `criteria` together, not just the example text. Browser actions,
message sending, music and video rendering still need separate host tools.

### Prefer the command line? (Optional)

These commands are for real Jev calls or input validation. **Mode B uses the agent directly, not the CLI.**

With `jev-decide` installed, save any complete **Input JSON** below as `request.json`.
Edit the context, questions and candidates for your task, then run in that file's directory:

```bash
jev-decide decide request.json --dry-run
```

After validation and approval to send that data to OpenRouter, make the live call and save its result:

```bash
jev-decide decide request.json > result.json
```

Read `result.json`, not just the process exit code. Exit `0` means selected/scored,
`2` means review, and `1` means error; selecting an action does not execute it.
If you installed only the general `jev` skill without the CLI, replace `jev-decide`
with `python3 <actual-skill-directory>/scripts/jev.py`.

## 🧪 What goes in, what comes out

These are **saved results from real Jev calls on synthetic examples**. Here is the
short version; each link opens the full input and output below.

| Try it on… | 📥 Input excerpt | 📤 Observed output |
|---|---|---|
| [A stuck agent](#sc-a02) | “Same UnicodeDecodeError, twice. No source change between runs.” Choose: inspect the input, retry unchanged, report done or ask the user. | `next_step = inspect_input`<br />`stuck = true`, yes-probability `0.88` |
| [A support ticket](#sc-h02) | “The export button returns an error for all team members. We need the monthly report tomorrow.” Choose a queue and rate urgency. | `queue = bug`<br />`urgency = 1.29 / 2` |
| [A document](#sc-spans) | `s1`: General questions: hello@example.invalid<br />`s2`: Send invoices to accounts@example.invalid<br />Which span is for invoice delivery? Does the claim naming `s1` hold? | `source = s2`, probability `0.97`<br />`claim_support = contradicted` |

**All 14 I/O pairs:** [recovery](#sc-a02) · [completion](#sc-a06) ·
[code review](#sc-a08) · [model routing](#sc-a16) · [file search](#sc-a20) ·
[context](#sc-a21) · [browser choices ×2](#sc-a23) · [support triage ×2](#sc-h02) ·
[document evidence](#sc-spans) · [simulation](#sc-a28) · [idea rubric](#sc-h25) · [voice direction](#sc-tts).

Each **Input** block reproduces the saved request: model, context (`state`), questions
and candidate definitions. Each **Output** block shows the CLI-normalized decisions;
the linked receipt also contains the raw API response and distributions. The requests
remain in their original English. These calls did not execute the chosen actions.
For Noul, `probability` means **P(true)** even when `value` is false; a rubric score
such as 1.29/2 is **not** a probability.

## ⚡ Two habits that make Jev useful

- **Give it enough context.** Include the goal, rules, source evidence, relevant
  history and candidate meanings. Jev does not inherit your agent's conversation.
  Keep the question narrow, not the evidence artificially tiny.
- **Parallelize independent judgments.** Ask several questions over one shared
  state in one request; run independent requests with bounded host concurrency.
  This is especially useful for replacing serial LLM classification, scoring and
  routing in large jobs. Dependent steps still need fresh state; Jev does not
  replace open-ended planning or text generation.

All nine skills teach these rules. [Context and throughput guide](skills/jev/references/context-and-throughput.md)

### 1. Goal-drift checkpoint

> Use Jev: **Noul:** “Does this action directly advance acceptance check C3?” Criteria: concrete link to the check, not merely useful adjacent cleanup.

- **Input → output:** Goal, active acceptance check, recent observed result, proposed action.
- **Use the result:** Low/uncertain support triggers a replan note; it does not erase work or redefine the user's goal. Test for false interruptions.
- **Customize:** Milestone triggers, acceptance criteria and permitted side work.

- **Status:** Adaptation; this exact recipe has not been individually evaluated.

<a id="sc-a02"></a>
<!-- covers: A02 -->
### 2. Stuck-loop recovery

> Use Jev: **Choice:** `inspect_error` (unread evidence), `change_hypothesis` (same approach failed), `verify_fix` (new success evidence), `escalate_unknown`.

- **Input → output:** Last three attempts, commands, exit codes, error excerpts, changed inputs.
- **Use the result:** The main agent selects a concrete recovery tool within the chosen route. Exact repeated commands can be counted without Jev; never endlessly retry because a score is high.
- **Customize:** Failure window, diagnostic tools and retry limits.
- **Start:** [jev](skills/jev/SKILL.md) · [Template to adapt](skills/jev/assets/checkpoint.json).
- **Sources:** [R02](skills/jev/references/community.md#r02) · [P03](skills/jev/references/community.md#p03)

### 3. Completion evidence check

> Use Jev: **Noul per criterion:** “Does the supplied evidence support criterion C2?” Require evidence for that criterion, not a generic success log.

- **Input → output:** Acceptance checklist plus actual artifact IDs, test receipts and their revision hashes.
- **Use the result:** Run missing checks or report partial completion. Code checks freshness and exit status; Jev cannot certify a test ran or a file exists.

### 4. Detect unsupported success language

> Use Jev: **Noul:** “Does this message claim a successful outcome not established by the ledger?” Distinguish planned, attempted and observed.

- **Input → output:** Proposed final claim and a minimal, independently captured execution ledger.
- **Use the result:** Revise the claim or collect evidence. Never convert the classifier's agreement into a success receipt. Preserve raw contradictory results.
- **Customize:** Distinguish planned, attempted and observed outcomes.

### 7. Test weakening / reward gaming

> Use Jev: **Noul:** “Does this edit weaken a required check without implementing the requirement?” Show before/after assertion behavior.

- **Input → output:** Changed assertions, original task, protected test intent.
- **Use the result:** Route to review; deterministic checks separately catch removed/skipped tests. A test change can be legitimate; do not call it deliberate cheating from a score.
- **Customize:** Protected assertions and legitimate test-change exceptions.
- **Start:** [jev-code-review](skills/jev-code-review/SKILL.md) · [Template to adapt](skills/jev-code-review/assets/example.json).
- **Sources:** [P03](skills/jev/references/community.md#p03)

### 28. Browser wait versus intervention

> Use Jev: **Choice:** `wait_for_results`, `refresh_observation`, `inspect_error`, `needs_login_or_consent`, `blocked`.

- **Input → output:** Current page status, observed loading/error states and recent action.
- **Use the result:** Bound waits and retries in code. Do not log in, accept terms, grant permissions or defeat a CAPTCHA because the classifier selects a route.
- **Customize:** Timeouts, retry limits and login/consent handoff.

### 29. Browser outcome verification

> Use Jev: **Noul per item:** “Does this observation establish the requested route?” Check other fields separately.

- **Input → output:** Fresh result readback and an explicit checklist, such as route/date/results visible.
- **Use the result:** Code validates exact dates/counts; independently inspect the resulting page. A `DONE` choice is only a request to verify, never proof of a booking/payment.
- **Customize:** Result checklist, exact-field validation and outcome receipts.

### 83. Keep simulated negotiation from stalling

> Use Jev: In this Catan-style negotiation, choose accept, counter, decline or pass from legal moves, and stop after the no-progress budget is exhausted.

- **Input → output:** Offer history + legal options → local response → host progress/deadlock check.
- **Customize:** Negotiation budget, utility rubric, pass/terminate options and progress definition.
- **Start:** [jev-simulation](skills/jev-simulation/SKILL.md) · [Template to adapt](skills/jev-simulation/assets/example.json).
- **Sources:** [Catan failure report](skills/jev/references/twitter-workflows.md#x06)
- **Status:** The source reports agents stopping negotiation; this is a failure-informed adaptation, not a demonstrated fix.

### 85. Keep a roleplay or story consistent over time

> After each scene, score its tone, tension and consistency with my character card. Suggest one correction only when a sustained drift appears.

- **Input → output:** Character/world rules + recent passages → independent anchored scores, tracked across turns.
- **Customize:** Sensors, recent-context window, rolling thresholds and whether to suggest a nudge or request a reroll.
- **Try:** [jev-simulation](skills/jev-simulation/SKILL.md) · [Rubric template](skills/jev/assets/rubric.json).

### 86. Compose editable music by choosing musical parts

> Build a gentle waltz: choose a meter, instruments, chords and each next bar from legal candidates. Let code render and export the MIDI.

- **Input → output:** Musical brief, harmony plan, motif and recent bars → bounded musical choices → editable notes.
- **Customize:** Candidate patterns, instruments, style, locked tracks and regeneration region. Dependent bars use updated context.
- **Try:** [jev](skills/jev/SKILL.md) · [Choice template](skills/jev/assets/checkpoint.json) to adapt; bring your own candidate generator/renderer.

<a id="sc-compile"></a>
<!-- covers: M22 -->
### 87. Turn a plain-language task into editable questions

> Use Jev: Turn “find feedback about active blockers” into typed questions and criteria. Show near-miss examples before applying it to each record.

- **Input → output:** User request → model drafts questions → schema/rubric review → Jev judges scoped records.
- **Customize:** Question meaning, candidate labels, row IDs, rubric version and consumer.
- **Start:** [jev](skills/jev/SKILL.md) · [Template to adapt](skills/jev/assets/semantic-rules.json).
- **Sources:** [OpenRouter question compiler](https://openrouter.ai/labs/jev/compile)
- **Status:** Source-described pattern; this adaptation has not been run here.

<a id="sc-mcp"></a>
<!-- covers: E02 -->
### 88. Add reusable decision tools through MCP

> Use Jev: Expose either one generic evaluate tool or named classify/verify/rerank tools, with my editable criteria and an explicit review path.

- **Input → output:** Agent tool call + state/questions → typed judgment → existing host workflow.
- **Customize:** Tool surface, model pin, provider and downstream action policy.
- **Start:** [jev](skills/jev/SKILL.md) · [Template to adapt](skills/jev/assets/triage.json).
- **Sources:** [TypeSafe MCP](https://github.com/itsmostafa/typesafe-mcp) · [Jev MCP](https://github.com/jkudish/jev-mcp)
- **Status:** Both checked versions support OpenRouter; neither installed here. Setup helpers may change configs/store keys: review them first.

<a id="sc-playground"></a>
<!-- covers: E03 U29 -->
### 89. Learn by changing examples in a playground

> Use Jev: Clone a reviewed playground, inspect one example’s state, questions, sample inputs and consumer, then ask the coding agent to add a related example.

- **Input → output:** Editable example → alternative inputs → inspect judgments and consumer behavior.
- **Customize:** Task, rubric, edge cases, live/mock mode and consumer.
- **Start:** [jev](skills/jev/SKILL.md) · [Template to adapt](skills/jev/assets/triage.json).
- **Sources:** [TypeSafe AI Playground](https://github.com/TypeSafeAI/typesafe-playground) · [Jev Explained](https://github.com/davila7/jev-explained)
- **Status:** READMEs checked; playgrounds not run. TypeSafe AI Playground documents live calls, mocks and local solvers separately.

<a id="sc-local-comparison"></a>
<!-- covers: D05 -->
### 90. Compare Jev decisions with a local-model baseline

> Keep the same records, questions and held-out labels. Compare hosted Jev with a local typed-decision adapter on quality, latency and review rate.

- **Input → output:** Fixed evaluation cases → separate model scorecards, raw outputs and error analysis.
- **Customize:** Local model, deployment, question wording, label mapping and calibration checks. Do not compare latency alone.
- **Try:** [Evaluation protocol](evals/README.md) · [Calibration protocol](evals/CALIBRATION.md).
- **Source:** [Jevify](https://github.com/fidecastro/jevify) · [September 20 author post](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenSourceeAI/comments/1wl9m9n/jevify_super_simple_way_to_serve_llms_as_a/).
- **Status:** Adapter README checked, not installed. This is not Jev’s weights or RLCD; this CLI still uses OpenRouter and does not silently switch endpoints.


## 🎯 Make probabilities useful

“Auto-handle / stronger model / person” is a **customizable policy**, not a universal
0.9/0.7 rule. First define which answer's probability you mean, check it against
held-out labels and choose thresholds for the cost of mistakes. A `score` is not
a probability; confidence is not permission. [Calibration guide](skills/jev/references/calibration.md).

For every scenario: keep an unknown route, observe fresh state and verify the
outcome after acting. Jev does not browse, execute tools or generate prose by itself.
Data sent for judgment goes to OpenRouter and its provider; use synthetic data first.

<a id="experiments"></a>
## 🧪 Experiments you can inspect

- [Agent before/after](evals/RESULTS.md): 12 pairs, baseline 12/12 vs fixed-checkpoint 10/12. Small negative result for that integration policy.
- [Decision/calibration pilot](evals/CALIBRATION_RESULTS.md): 136/160 benchmark labels matched; the confidence ≥0.9 group still had 8/100 errors.
- [Nine scenario API examples](evals/SCENARIO_EXAMPLES.md): observed answers for all eight focused skills plus voice direction; no host actions.
- [Five earlier live API examples](evals/results/examples-2026-09-20.json): request/response smoke receipts, not scenario-level accuracy tests.
- [Validation and reproduction](docs/validation.md): package checks, dry runs and untested host boundaries are recorded separately.
