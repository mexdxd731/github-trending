> **No support.** This is a one-time open-source release. Issues are off, and setup questions go unanswered. Fork it, deploy it, make it yours.

## Why

Newsletter platforms charge for every subscriber, every month. With your own SES account you pay for the emails you send: 10,000 readers and 4 issues a month is 40,000 emails, about $4.

Mailcheap is the rest of what a newsletter needs, in one small Next.js app: an editor, a list, signup forms, unsubscribe handling, bounce and complaint handling, stats and a public archive. One admin, no teams, no plans. Your list stays in your database.

## Features

**Write and send**

- Editor with a live email preview, slash commands, image uploads and boxes. Markdown and raw HTML work too.
- Checks before every send: subject, preview text, unsubscribe link, size under Gmail's 100 KB clip, postal address, verified domain.
- Test emails, scheduling, and sending in batches through QStash at the rate you set.
- Send in steps: start with your most engaged readers, then send to more.

**Grow the list**

- Several newsletters in one install, each with its own from address, reply-to and postal address.
- A signup form on each newsletter's archive, and a signup API with API keys.
- Confirmed opt-in per newsletter, off by default. Welcome email.
- Rate limits on signups, login, unsubscribes and the API, on by default.

**Keep it healthy**

- SES events (deliveries, bounces, complaints) and a suppression list shared by every newsletter.
- A send pauses itself when bounces pass 2% or complaints pass 0.08%.
- One-click unsubscribe (RFC 8058 `List-Unsubscribe` headers) and an unsubscribe page, with signed links.
- List cleanup, off by default: readers who ignored several issues get one "do you still want this?" email, then stop getting issues.
- Open and click tracking on your own domain, with link scanners filtered out.

**Publish and measure**

- A public archive for each newsletter: issue pages, author page, share images, sitemap. Optional custom domain.
- Overview with subscribers over time, emails per hour, and delivery, open, click, bounce and complaint rates.
- Campaign reports by mailbox provider (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, iCloud...).
- Contacts with search, status filters and CSV import from any platform.
- A domains page with each SES identity's DKIM and MAIL FROM status and the DNS records to add.

## What you need

| Service | For | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) | Contacts, campaigns, stats | Free tier works |
| [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) | Sending | About $0.10 per 1,000 emails |
| [Upstash QStash](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash) | Background sending and scheduling | Free tier to start, then pay per message. One message sends 50 emails. |
| [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or any Node.js host | Hosting | Free tier works |
| [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/docs/redis) (optional) | Rate limits shared by every server instance | Free tier |
| [Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-blob) (optional) | Image uploads in the editor | Free tier |

Without Redis, Mailcheap counts the same rate limits in each server instance's memory. That still stops a script hammering a form, but on serverless hosts the limits aren't shared between instances and reset on each deploy. Add Redis before you put a signup form on a busy site.

Without Blob, image uploads in the editor are off. HTML and Markdown campaigns can still use images hosted anywhere.

## Setup

Plan for about an hour, most of it waiting for DNS and for AWS to approve production access.

### 1. Database

1. Create a free cluster on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas).
2. **Database Access**: add a user with a password and the "Read and write to any database" role.
3. **Network Access**: allow `0.0.0.0/0`. Vercel doesn't have fixed IP addresses.
4. **Connect > Drivers**: copy the connection string and add a database name before the `?`, like `...mongodb.net/mailcheap?retryWrites=true`. That's your `MONGODB_URI`.

### 2. Deploy

1. Click **Deploy** above.
2. Fill in `MONGODB_URI`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (at least 12 characters) and `SESSION_SECRET` (at least 32; generate it with `openssl rand -base64 48`). With shorter ones, Mailcheap refuses to start and the logs say which one to fix.
3. Open `https://<your-project>.vercel.app/login` and log in.

Sending is off until you finish the next steps, so nothing can go out by mistake. On any other Node.js host: `npm ci && npm run build && npm start`, with the same variables, behind HTTPS.

If you plan to use your own domain for the dashboard (like `mailcheap.example.com`), add it in Vercel now and set `APP_URL` to it. Links in your emails use `APP_URL`, so it should be final before your first send.

### 3. Amazon SES

Use one AWS region for everything below (the examples use `us-east-1`).

1. **Verify a sending domain.** In the SES console, go to **Identities > Create identity > Domain**. Use a subdomain like `mail.example.com`, so your main domain's email is unaffected. Keep Easy DKIM with RSA 2048 and add the 3 CNAME records SES gives you at your DNS provider.
2. **Set a custom MAIL FROM domain.** On the identity, open **Custom MAIL FROM domain > Edit**, use `bounce.mail.example.com`, and add the MX and TXT records SES shows. This aligns SPF with your domain.
3. **Add DMARC** if your root domain doesn't have one: a TXT record at `_dmarc.example.com` with `v=DMARC1; p=none;` to start. Gmail and Yahoo require DMARC from bulk senders.
4. **Request production access.** New accounts are in the sandbox (200 emails a day, verified recipients only). In **Account dashboard > Request production access**, pick Marketing, and explain that readers opt in, that bounces and complaints are suppressed automatically, and that every email has one-click unsubscribe. AWS usually answers within a day.
5. **Create a configuration set**, named `mailcheap` for example, under **Configuration sets**. Leave SES open and click tracking off: Mailcheap tracks on your own domain.
6. **Create an SNS topic.** In the SNS console, create a standard topic, like `mailcheap-ses-events`, and copy its ARN. Then switch it to signature version 2, which signs messages with SHA256 instead of SHA1: `aws sns set-topic-attributes --topic-arn <topic-arn> --attribute-name SignatureVersion --attribute-value 2`.
7. **Send SES events to the topic.** In the configuration set, open **Event destinations > Add destination**. Select hard bounces, complaints, deliveries, delivery delays, rejects and rendering failures, then pick Amazon SNS and your topic.
8. **Create an IAM user for Mailcheap** with this policy, then create an access key for it:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["ses:SendEmail", "ses:SendRawEmail"],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:<account-id>:identity/mail.example.com",
        "arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:<account-id>:configuration-set/mailcheap"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["ses:GetAccount", "ses:ListEmailIdentities", "ses:GetEmailIdentity"],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

9. **Add the variables in Vercel** and redeploy: `SES_REGION`, `SES_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `SES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `SES_CONFIGURATION_SET` and `SES_SNS_TOPIC_ARN`.
10. **Subscribe Mailcheap to the topic.** In the SNS topic, **Create subscription** with protocol HTTPS and endpoint `https://<your-app>/api/webhooks/ses`. Leave raw message delivery off. Mailcheap confirms the subscription by itself; refresh and the status turns to Confirmed.

The **Domains** page in Mailcheap now shows your domain with its DKIM and MAIL FROM status. Optional: in SES **Account dashboard > Suppression list**, turn on the account-level list for bounces and complaints too.

### 4. QStash

1. In the [Upstash console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash), open QStash and copy `QSTASH_TOKEN`, `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY` and `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` (and `QSTASH_URL` if you picked a region other than the default).
2. Add them in Vercel and redeploy.

QStash calls `APP_URL/api/jobs/...` to send each batch, so the app has to be reachable on the internet. Mailcheap checks QStash's signature on every job.

### 5. Turn sending on

1. In Mailcheap, create a newsletter. The from address must be on your verified domain, and the postal address shows in every email's footer (anti-spam laws require one).
2. Set `SENDING_ENABLED=true` in Vercel and redeploy.
3. Write a campaign, send yourself a test, then send. For a new domain, set a limit to reach your most engaged readers first, and use **Send to more** on the report once the first step looks healthy.

### Optional

- **Archive on its own domain:** add the domain to your Vercel project, then set `ARCHIVE_HOSTS=news.example.com=<newsletter-slug>` and redeploy. That domain serves only the archive and the unsubscribe page, never the dashboard, and the app domain's `/archive/<newsletter-slug>` pages redirect there.

  This is the safer setup: issue pages show HTML from your editor and from API keys, and on their own domain that HTML never shares the dashboard's origin. Without one, the archive stays on the app domain, where the sanitizer, the sandboxed frame and the Content Security Policy protect it.
- **Image uploads:** in Vercel, **Storage > Create > Blob**, connect it to the project, and redeploy.
- **Shared rate limits:** create a Redis database in the [Upstash console](https://console.upstash.com/redis) and add `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`.
- **Alerts:** set `ALERT_FROM` (like `Mailcheap <alerts@mail.example.com>`) to get alerts by email at `ADMIN_EMAIL`: spam complaints, paused sends, signup floods and rate limiter outages, plus every login, new API key and send. Otherwise they only show in the logs.

## Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/mailcheap.git && cd mailcheap
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # set MONGODB_URI, ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD, SESSION_SECRET
npm run dev
```

A local MongoDB works: `docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo` and `MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/mailcheap`.

- Sending stays off locally unless you set `SENDING_ENABLED=true`. When the SES keys are empty, the AWS SDK falls back to your default AWS credentials (`~/.aws`), so the domains page can show real data.
- QStash can't reach `localhost`. To try a full send locally, run the QStash dev server (`npx @upstash/qstash-cli dev`) and use the URL, token and signing keys it prints.
- `npm test` runs the unit tests and `npm run lint` runs ESLint.

## Deliverability basics

- **Send from a subdomain** (`mail.example.com`), so a bad week doesn't affect your main domain's email.
- **Authenticate everything:** DKIM (Easy DKIM), SPF through the custom MAIL FROM domain, and DMARC on the root domain.
- **Only email people who asked.** Never import a bought or scraped list. If bots fill your forms, turn on confirmed opt-in.
- **Warm up a new domain.** Send to your most engaged readers first, and grow each send over a few weeks.
- **Watch complaints and bounces.** Keep complaints under 0.1% and bounces under 2%. Mailcheap pauses a send above 0.08% complaints or 2% bounces. Add your domain to [Google Postmaster Tools](https://postmaster.google.com) to see your spam rate at Gmail.
- **Make leaving easy.** Every email has one-click unsubscribe headers and a footer link, which Gmail and Yahoo require.
- **Clean your list.** Turn on list cleanup in each newsletter's settings to stop emailing people who never open.
- **Keep emails under 100 KB**, or Gmail clips them and hides the unsubscribe link.

## Environment variables

## API

Create a key on the **API keys** page and send it as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`.

**Add a contact**: `POST /api/v1/contacts`

```bash
curl -X POST https://<your-app>/api/v1/contacts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MAILCHEAP_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"newsletter":"weekly","email":"jane@example.com","source":"website","ip":"203.0.113.7"}'
```

- `newsletter` (slug) and `email` are required. `source` labels where the signup came from.
- `resubscribe: true` brings back someone who unsubscribed (never someone who bounced or complained).
- Pass your visitor's IP as `ip` to get the per-visitor limit of 5 signups per 10 minutes. Each key is also limited to 600 signups an hour.
- Answers `201` for a new contact, `200` if it already existed, with `{ id, status, created }`. When the newsletter confirms signups, `status` is `pending` and `inbox` links to the reader's email provider for your "check your inbox" message.

**Create a draft**: `POST /api/v1/campaigns` with `newsletter`, `subject`, `previewText` (optional), `html` or `markdown`, and `archiveSlug` (optional). Answers `201` with the draft's id and dashboard URL. Sending stays a click in the dashboard.

**List sent issues**: `GET /api/v1/campaigns?newsletter=<slug>` returns each issue's id, subject, preview text, archive URL and send date.

## How it works

- Next.js App Router, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui, MongoDB through Mongoose.
- **Send** picks the audience (active contacts, suppressions left out, most engaged first), creates one message per reader, and queues one QStash job per batch of 50. Each job sends through the SES v2 API at `SEND_RATE_PER_SECOND` and pauses the campaign if bounce or complaint rates pass the limits.
- Welcome and confirmation emails go out right away, capped at 100 every 10 minutes per newsletter.
- SES publishes events to SNS, which posts them to `/api/webhooks/ses`. Mailcheap verifies the SNS signature, updates the message, the campaign stats and the contact, and suppresses bounced and complaining addresses for every newsletter.
- Opens and clicks go through `/o/...` and `/c/...` on your app's domain. Clicks within 30 seconds of the send, or from known link scanners, don't count.
- Archive pages are static and refresh when you send or save.
