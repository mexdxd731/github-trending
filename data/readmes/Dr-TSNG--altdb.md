# altdb

A KernelSU module that provides wireless ADB over your local network.

Connect with the standard `adb` client and manage pairing, ports and permissions through the module WebUI.
System adbd and its existing authorizations are left untouched.

## Features

- Six-digit pairing codes and TLS-encrypted connections. Paired computers can reconnect without pairing again.
- Shell access, file transfers, app installation and removal, logs, reboot, and forward/reverse port forwarding.
- Wi-Fi, hotspots and Ethernet over IPv4. Cellular and VPN interfaces are excluded.
- Automatic pause when system USB or wireless debugging is enabled, followed by recovery once debugging is disabled and system adbd has stopped.
- Session preservation during framework-only soft restarts, while the daemon and network remain alive.
- A WebUI for status, connection commands, paired computers and diagnostics, available in English and Simplified Chinese.

## Requirements

- Android 11 or later on an ARM64 device.
- KernelSU v3.2.5 (32525) or later.
- A computer with `adb` installed, on a network that can reach the phone.

## Getting started

1. Install the module ZIP in KernelSU Manager and restart the phone.
2. Turn off system USB debugging and wireless debugging.
3. Open the module WebUI, wait for the service to start, then select **Start pairing**.
4. Run the commands shown in the WebUI on your computer. Enter the six-digit code when prompted:

   ```sh
   adb pair PHONE_IP:PAIRING_PORT
   adb connect PHONE_IP:CONNECTION_PORT
   ```

Pairing and connection ports are different. The pairing window lasts five minutes and closes after a successful pairing.
On later connections, use `adb connect` directly. Paired computers may also reconnect automatically when network discovery is available.

## Settings and permissions

Use the WebUI to configure:

- **Connection port:** Random by default, or a fixed port from `1024–65535`. An occupied fixed port is reported as an error.
- **Allow adb root:** Off by default. When enabled, `adb root` switches services to root and all computers must reconnect. `adb unroot` or a service restart restores shell access.
- **Allow shell to use su:** Off by default. When enabled, root access through `su` still depends on KernelSU's authorization for shell.
- **Paired computers:** Revoking a computer disconnects it immediately. It must pair again to reconnect.
- **Language:** Follows the system by default. A manual language choice is saved on the device.

Connections use shell permissions by default. Changing permission switches disconnects existing sessions. Module upgrades preserve settings and pairing records; uninstalling removes the module's own data. CLI messages are in English.

## Scope

altdb provides local-network ADB only. USB transport, JDWP/IDE debugging, incremental installation, remount, verity and recovery sideload are not supported. Some system commands depend on device permissions.

If a connection fails, check the pause reason in the WebUI, confirm that system debugging is off and the network is reachable, then try the manual connection command shown on the page.
