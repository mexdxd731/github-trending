Hookshot is a static recompilation. The game's code is translated to C and compiled into a Windows program, the
console's system software is reimplemented, and the Switch 2 graphics are rebuilt on Vulkan. All of this happens
**on your PC, from your own copy of the game**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository **does not contain the game, keys or an executable**, and it does not explain how to get them. You
> need your own copy. Everything the build creates (`hookshot.exe`, the generated code, the shader caches and your
> saves) comes from your game and stays on your PC. Never share those files.

## Project status

Experimental. It has only been tested on **one PC** (Ryzen 5 7600X, RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB), mostly in the area at the start
of the game.

| What | Status |
|---|---|
| Kokiri Forest: reaching gameplay and walking around | ✅ Works |
| Sound, controller, keyboard and saves | ✅ Works |
| In-game menu, frame generation and upscaling | ✅ Works |
| Black flashes while moving | ✅ Fixed in testing, more play needed |
| Performance without frame generation | ⚠️ About 50 fps walking, not yet a steady 60 |
| Models with missing pieces (doors, fences, parts of trees) | ✅ Fixed where tested, more play needed |
| Stutter when entering new areas | ⚠️ Still happens, mostly the first time |
| Ultrawide | ⚠️ The 3D keeps its shape, but the HUD is stretched and the picture is softer |
| Hyrule Field and the rest of the game | ❓ Not tested yet |
| AMD and Intel cards | ❓ Never tested |

## How to build

The game does not come ready-made: it is built on your PC from your copy.

**With Hookshot Builder, the easiest:**

1. Download the HookshotBuilder zip from the Releases page, extract it, and run `HookshotBuilder.exe`. Keep the `tools`
   folder beside it.
2. Choose your game's `.nup`, or your `romfs` and `exefs` folders. The builder checks that it is the right version.
3. Choose a language and a folder for the finished game, and start the build.
4. When it finishes, open `hookshot.exe` in that folder.

**From the command line:**

```powershell
python -I nx2/make_game.py --nup "C:\path\your-game.nup" --out "C:\Games\Hookshot" --language en-US
```

Or with folders:

```powershell
python -I nx2/make_game.py --romfs "C:\path\romfs" --exefs "C:\path\exefs" --out "C:\Games\Hookshot" --language en-US
```

Add `--check` with your `.nup` or `--exefs` to only check the game's version. It builds nothing.

A build takes about 40 minutes, and you can use your PC in the meantime.

### On Linux

1. Download `Hookshot-<version>-x86_64.AppImage` from the Releases page (or the Linux AppImage workflow's artifact),
   make it executable (`chmod +x`) and start it. It is Hookshot Builder with everything it needs inside: the compiler,
   the libraries and the Vulkan renderer. Nothing else has to be installed.
2. Choose your `.nup` (or your `romfs` and `exefs` folders), a language and a folder for the game, and build.
3. When it finishes, press Play. The game is also added to your applications menu, and starting the AppImage again
   offers Play. The game itself is `hookshot` in the folder you chose: it runs without the AppImage.

From the command line: `./Hookshot-<version>-x86_64.AppImage --cli --nup ~/your-game.nup --out ~/Games/Hookshot`
(the same options as `make_game.py`).

You need a 64-bit x86 PC with glibc 2.35 or newer (Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, Fedora, Arch, SteamOS ...), a Vulkan 1.3
driver with mesh shaders (Mesa or NVIDIA), and the same memory and disk space as on Windows. The build's own files go
to `~/.cache/hookshot-builder`. Saves go in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/hookshot` (`~/.local/share/hookshot`). A `user` folder
beside the game from an earlier build is moved there once. `HOOKSHOT_JOBS` sets how many files compile at once.
Switches to test (`RX_VK_NOOPT=1` and the others) go in `hookshot_env.txt` beside the game, one `NAME=VALUE` a line,
as on Windows.

Building it yourself without the AppImage: `clang` and `lld` (LLVM 23 or newer reads the play profile; an older one
builds without it), Python 3 with `lz4`, `numpy`, `capstone`, `unicorn` and `zstandard`, FFmpeg's development files
(with dav1d, for the movies) and SDL2. Then `python -I nx2/make_game.py ...` as above, with `RX_CPM` pointing at a folder
with Vulkan-Headers, SPIRV-Headers and VulkanMemoryAllocator in CPM's layout (`scripts/linux/deps.sh` makes one).
`scripts/linux/deps.sh` and `scripts/linux/appimage.sh` make the AppImage.

### Updating to a newer release

A new release is not a patch to your game folder: the game is built again from your copy, with the new code. Your
saves and settings are kept.

1. Close the game.
2. To be safe, copy your saves somewhere first: the `user` folder beside `hookshot.exe` on Windows, or
   `~/.local/share/hookshot` on Linux.
3. Get the new release:
   - **Hookshot Builder:** download the new HookshotBuilder zip and extract it to a new folder (with its `tools`
     folder). The old builder folder can then be deleted.
   - **Linux:** download the new AppImage and make it executable. The old one can be deleted, the game is not removed with it.
   - **Command line:** `git pull` in your clone, and take the `tools` folder's contents (see
     [What you need](#what-you-need)) from the new HookshotBuilder zip, as they can change between releases.
4. Build again with the same `.nup` (or `romfs` and `exefs` folders) and **the same game folder** as before. With the
   same `.nup`, the game is not read again, but the translation and the compile still run, so it takes about as long
   as the first build.
5. Start the game as before.

What a new build keeps and what it replaces in the game folder:

| Kept | Replaced |
|---|---|
| Your saves (`user`, or `~/.local/share/hookshot` on Linux) | `hookshot.exe` (`hookshot` on Linux) and its files |
| `hookshot_options.ini`, the in-game menu's choices | `image.bin` and the shader list |
| `hookshot_env.txt` | `language.txt`, written again with the language you choose |

### What you need

- The Visual Studio C++ tools and the Windows SDK. Microsoft does not allow these to be bundled, so install
  [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with "Desktop development with C++". The
  builder tells you if they are missing.
- 64-bit Windows 10 or 11.
- A graphics card with Vulkan 1.3 and mesh shaders, with an up-to-date driver. Only NVIDIA has been tested.
- 16 GB of RAM or more. A run uses about 10 GB.
- About 60 GB free while building.
- **Your copy of the game at the supported version:** program `0400486024DEC000`, update v131072, build `e0f3ccfa`.
  Other versions do not work.

To build from the command line you also need:

- Python 3 with `lz4`, `numpy`, `capstone`, `unicorn` and `zstandard`:
  `pip install lz4 numpy capstone "unicorn>=2.1,<2.2" zstandard`
  Use Python from python.org: the Microsoft Store's Python installs packages where `python -I` does not look.
- The clang from [emsdk](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk), at `C:\emsdk`.
- Visual Studio 2022 with .NET 8, only if you want to change the builder itself.
- The prebuilt tools that go in `third_party/`: `a64emit`, `lld-link`, `zbic` and SDL2.
- What the HookshotBuilder zip carries in its `tools` folder and a clone does not. The builder sets the variables
  below itself; from the command line, set them before you run `make_game.py`:
  - `tools\cpm`: the Vulkan headers and FFmpeg. Set `RX_CPM` to this folder. Without it the build leaves out
    `hookshot_vk.dll`, the Vulkan renderer, and says nothing.
  - `tools\wgpu-native`: set `WGPU_NATIVE` to this folder.
  - `tools\third_party\sdl2\SDL2.dll`: copy it to `third_party\sdl2\`.
  - `tools\work`: copy it, with its `image` folder, to `work\`. It holds the hot-function list, the link order, the
    profile and the icon; without them the game builds but runs slower.

### What this does on your PC

- The build reads your game and never changes it. It writes to the folder you choose and to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HookshotBuilder`.
- The romfs is hard-linked instead of copied where the disk allows it.
- To uninstall, delete the game folder and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HookshotBuilder`.

### If something goes wrong

| Problem | What to do |
|---|---|
| "Hookshot supports build e0f3ccfa" | Check that you chose the right game with its update installed |
| The game opens and closes | Update your graphics driver |
| Stutter the first time you see something | Normal for now: shaders are being prepared. It gets better when you pass through the same place again |
| The game is in the wrong language | Change the code in `language.txt` beside the game. The file lists them all |

If the problem continues, report it with where you were in the game, your graphics card and a screenshot or video.
Never send game files.

## In-game menu

Press <kbd>Insert</kbd> in game. Everything is off by default, and your choices are saved in `hookshot_options.ini`
beside the game.

| Option | Choices |
|---|---|
| Frame generation | Off, 2x, 3x, 4x |
| Frame pacing | Off, On |
| Resolution | Auto (the game's own dynamic resolution), 100%, 75%, 67%, 50% |
| Upscaling | Off, Catmull-Rom, Lanczos |
| Sharpness | 0 to 100% |
| Game speed | Per frame, Real time |
| Handheld profile | Off, On |
| Ultrawide | 16:9, Monitor's shape |
| FPS counter | Off, On |

With Game speed on Per frame, the game runs slower whenever it is below 60 fps. Real time keeps it at normal speed.

### Controls

Use a controller, or the keyboard and mouse. On the keyboard, <kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> move
and the arrow keys turn the camera.

## How it works

1. `nx2/lift.py` translates the game's ARM64 code to C.
2. `nx2/build.py` compiles that C together with `host/`, which plays the part of the console's system.
3. `host/nvn_native.c` records the game's NVN2 graphics calls, and `gpu/vk/` replays them on Vulkan.
4. Switch 2 Ampere shaders are lowered to Maxwell (`lower_to_maxwell.h`) and translated to SPIR-V by Eden's shader
   recompiler.

More detail is in the [development guide](docs/development.md) and the [design notes](docs/design.md).

## Want to help?

Testing on other graphics cards and reporting the result already helps a lot, and so does playing further into the
game than anyone has yet.

Bigger ways to help:

- **Linux testing.** The Linux build (`host/posix`) has been tested on one PC so far: reports from other distributions
  and graphics cards help.
- **Fixes in your own fork.** Fork the project, fix what you find and send the change back. Keep game files, keys and
  anything generated from your game out of it.
