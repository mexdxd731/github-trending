[English](README.md) · [简体中文](README.zh.md)

An open, portable Agent Skill for turning difficult systems into truthful,
interactive visual stories. It compiles a versioned JSON story spec into one
deterministic, self-contained HTML file that works offline.

The project combines an ELI5 layer with inspectable technical truth: readers
can follow a real request or event through the system, inspect the evidence
behind each conclusion, explore failure behavior, annotate scenes, and export
the result without sending source material to a remote runtime.

_A generated Chinese scene showing the graph, local actions, and conclusion-level evidence together._

## Why it is different

- **Truth Ladder** — separates analogy, technical mechanism, and caveats.
- **Evidence at the claim** — each scene can show source status, core text,
  support scope, and a URL or explicit no-locator boundary.
- **Four story grammars** — concept, repository module, engineering tradeoff,
  and incident, each with a dedicated summary view and semantic validator.
- **Detailed playback** — global or scene-local traces animate real nodes,
  relationships, labels, arrow markers, evidence cards, and enter/hold/exit
  phases while keeping the active scene in view.
- **Failure lens and teach-back** — impact, symptom, fallback, questions, and
  answer reveals are part of the explainer rather than an appendix.
- **Reader workspace** — opt-in same-origin history, favorites, plain-text
  annotations, and keyboard-accessible scene navigation.
- **Local export** — PDF, scene PNG, all-scene PPTX, Pages-compatible DOCX, and
  optional verified native `.pages` conversion.
- **Portable by construction** — no runtime packages, remote fonts, remote
  resources, or network access during render.

## Requirements

- **Skill runtime:** Node.js 18 or newer and local file access.
- **Package dependencies:** none. There is no `npm install`, Python runtime,
  remote font, or remote rendering service.
- **Rendering:** no browser or network connection is required.
- **Reading and export:** use a modern browser for the interactive HTML and
  local PDF, PNG, PPTX, or DOCX export.
- **Optional native `.pages` export:** macOS, Apple Pages, and the bundled
  loopback helper.

The installer and the installed Skill have separate requirements. The
`skills@1.5.23` CLI used by the release canary requires Node.js 22.20 or newer;
the installed Skill still runs on Node.js 18 or newer. Installation needs
one-time access to the public GitHub repository; the `npx` route also needs the
npm registry. A public install needs no GitHub account or token.

## Install

### Natural language (recommended)

Paste one of these requests into your agent. It should inspect `SKILL.md`,
refuse to overwrite an existing installation without permission, and report
the final location.

**Codex**

> Install the `fireworks-open-eli5` Agent Skill globally from
> `https://github.com/yizhiyanhua-ai/fireworks-open-eli5` using Codex's Skill
> installer. The repository root (`.`) is the Skill directory and its installed
> name must be `fireworks-open-eli5`. Review `SKILL.md` first, do not replace an
> existing copy without asking, verify the installed path, and tell me whether
> I need a new Codex task before using it.

**Claude Code**

> Install the `fireworks-open-eli5` Agent Skill globally for Claude Code from
> `https://github.com/yizhiyanhua-ai/fireworks-open-eli5`. Review `SKILL.md`
> first, use the Agent Skills CLI when available, and do not replace an existing
> copy without asking. If the installer requirement is not met, report it
> without changing my Node.js installation. Verify that Claude Code can
> discover the Skill and report the installed path.

### Install with `npx`

The open [Agent Skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) supports both
Codex and Claude Code:

```bash
# Codex
npx skills@latest add yizhiyanhua-ai/fireworks-open-eli5 -g -a codex -y

# Claude Code
npx skills@latest add yizhiyanhua-ai/fireworks-open-eli5 -g -a claude-code -y

# Both agents
npx skills@latest add yizhiyanhua-ai/fireworks-open-eli5 -g -a codex -a claude-code -y
```

`-g` installs at user scope. Remove it for a project-local installation. Check
the result with `npx skills@latest list -g --json`, then start a fresh agent
task so the Skill is rediscovered. Review Skills before using them: they run
with the permissions of the host agent.

## Quick start

```bash
node scripts/validate.mjs assets/example-spec.json
node scripts/render.mjs assets/example-spec.json example.html
node scripts/validate.mjs assets/example-spec.json example.html
```

The commands print compact JSON and exit nonzero on failure. Rendering is
create-only by default. Use `--force` only to intentionally replace a known
regular file; symbolic links are always rejected.

Run the complete contributor and distribution gate:

```bash
npm run check
```

This checks JavaScript syntax, focused tests, the canonical example, release
package contents, and a render/validate canary from an unpacked archive.

On Node.js 22.20 or newer, also exercise an isolated Codex and Claude Code
installation through the pinned Agent Skills CLI release:

```bash
npm run check:agent-install
```

## Use as an Agent Skill

After installation, ask for an evidence-aware visual explanation, for example:

> Explain how one queued job moves through this repository. Cite real files,
> let me play the request path, and show what breaks when the lease expires.

Read [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for the agent workflow and
[references/spec-contract.md](references/spec-contract.md) for the version 1
story spec.

## Story pipeline

```text
question + audience + evidence
            │
            ▼
  versioned JSON story spec
            │ validate
            ▼
 deterministic HTML renderer
            │
            ├── offline interactive explainer
            ├── print / PDF
            ├── current-scene PNG
            ├── all-scene PPTX
            ├── Pages-compatible DOCX
            └── optional native Pages conversion
```

The JSON spec is the portable source of truth. The HTML contains its canonical
SHA-256, and the validator can byte-compare a supplied spec against a fresh
deterministic render.

## Reader workspace

Every explainer has a directory drawer. Favorites appear first, followed by
independent tabs for the current outline, previously opened explainers, and
annotation browsing. A reader can play, favorite, annotate, or export one scene
without starting the global trace.

The local library is disabled until the reader selects **Enable local
library**. It records only explainers actually opened at the same scheme, host,
and port; it never scans the filesystem. Favorites and annotations are
browser-local, unencrypted, and removed when that origin's browser data is
cleared. They never modify the source JSON or generated HTML. `file://` and
unavailable storage degrade to an in-memory session.

See [references/library-and-export.md](references/library-and-export.md) for
the persistence, privacy, accessibility, playback, and export contract.

## Export

| Action | Result | Verification boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Print / PDF | Browser print dialog | The reader chooses Save as PDF when available |
| PNG | 1600×900 image of the selected scene | PNG signature, dimensions, and scene evidence footer |
| PPTX | One 16:9 slide per scene | ZIP signature and required OOXML parts |
| DOCX | One 16:9 page per scene | ZIP signature and required OOXML parts |
| Native Pages | A real `.pages` package saved by Apple Pages | Must contain `Index/Document.iwa` and reopen in Pages |

PNG, PPTX, and DOCX are built locally in the browser without third-party
libraries. Native Pages conversion is never faked by renaming a DOCX. Serve a
trusted explainer directory with:

```bash
node scripts/serve.mjs --root /absolute/path/to/explainers --port 8772
```

The helper binds only to `127.0.0.1`, verifies exact origin and a rotating
process token, bounds and validates the generated DOCX/PNG structure, serializes
conversion, and cleans task-specific temporary files. These controls protect
the browser action from cross-site requests; they are not authentication
against other local processes.

## Security and privacy

The renderer reads local files and writes one local file. Generated HTML uses a
hash-whitelisted Content Security Policy, embeds no remote resources, and
contains no XHR, WebSocket, `eval`, or HTML-string DOM insertion. Its only
connection is a user-initiated same-origin request to the optional loopback
Pages helper. Cited HTTP(S) URLs are ordinary reader-facing links, never runtime
dependencies.

Annotations are capped and inserted as text. The validator rejects unsafe
source URLs, external resources, runtime tampering, spec-hash drift, and
unexpected CSP hashes. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) to report a vulnerability.

The release package uses an explicit allowlist and keeps `private: true` to
