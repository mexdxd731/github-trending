Self-contained recipe for serving the `Mia-AiLab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4`
checkpoint (99 GB) from a single DGX Spark's 121 GiB unified memory, via vLLM
with the PLE table offloaded and memory-mapped. This is a **vision-language**
model: text, images and video all work out of the box (see below). Nothing here depends on the
2-node files it was derived from.

```
cp .env.sample .env        # edit IMAGE / HF_TOKEN if needed
./download.sh              # fetch the ~99 GB checkpoint (resumable)
./start.sh                 # ~10-12 min to /health; serves on :8888
./stop.sh                  # container + watchdog, graceful
```

`start.sh` never downloads anything — it resolves the checkpoint from the local
Hugging Face cache and fails fast if it is absent. Budget ~130 GiB of free disk:
99 GB for the checkpoint plus the ~27 GB packed PLE table built on first launch.

`./start.sh --no-launch` prints the derived memory budget and the docker
command without running anything. `./stop.sh` sends SIGTERM and waits up to
`STOP_TIMEOUT` (default 30 s) so vLLM can unlink its POSIX shared memory —
the container runs with `--ipc host`, so segments it leaves behind leak onto
the host's `/dev/shm` until reboot. `./stop.sh --force` skips the wait.

## Measured profile

`.env.sample` ships **262,144 context (YaRN off), MTP 3, `KV_TARGET_GIB=22`,
`KV_CACHE_DTYPE=fp8`, `MAX_NUM_SEQS=4`**. Everything below was measured on
this host on 2026-09-04; each row names the configuration it came from, because
the numbers move a lot between them.

| Configuration | KV pool | Prefill @400k | Decode (prose, idle) | Needles 5/50/95% |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 262k, `KV_TARGET_GIB=20`, BF16 | 21.28 GiB = 736,837 tok (2.81x a 262k req) | — | — | — |
| 512k YaRN, `KV_TARGET_GIB=20`, BF16 | 19.2 GiB = 704,558 tok (1.34x a 512k req) | 1,537 tok/s (TTFT 260.3 s) | 28.3 tok/s (sd 2.6) | 3/3 PASS |
| 512k YaRN, `KV_TARGET_GIB=22`, BF16 | 796,196 tok (1.52x a 512k req) | 1,883 tok/s @32k | — | 12/14 (see FP8 section) |
| 512k YaRN, `KV_TARGET_GIB=22`, FP8 | 22.2 GiB = 1,431,164 tok (2.73x a 512k req) | 1,495 tok/s (TTFT 267.7 s); 1,769 tok/s @32k | 27.1 tok/s (sd 1.3) | 15/20 (see FP8 section) |

Host `MemAvailable` sits at ~12.9 GiB idle and dipped to a low-water 10.97 GiB
during a 400k prefill — see the safety rules for why that floor matters.

Two honest gaps: the **shipped default itself** (262k, `KV_TARGET_GIB=22`,
BF16) has not been benchmarked — the 262k row above is from the older
`KV_TARGET_GIB=20` profile and predates the `MADV_RANDOM` mmap change. Short-context (32k) prefill is now measured for both
dtypes; see the FP8 section.

### Prefill and decode, measured with sparkDash

The prefill sweep and prose decode numbers below were measured with
[sparkDash](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash) against this server
(`KV_CACHE_DTYPE=fp8`, 512k YaRN). Benchmark scripts are not shipped in this
repo; use sparkDash to reproduce them.

**Prefill** — throughput peaks around 32-64k, then falls away as attention cost
grows with context:

| context | TTFT | prefill |
|---|---|---|
| 8k | 5.00 s | 1,646 tok/s |
| 16k | 8.00 s | 2,052 tok/s |
| 32k | 15.83 s | **2,073 tok/s** |
| 64k | 32.20 s | 2,037 tok/s |
| 128k | 67.41 s | 1,945 tok/s |
| 256k | 146.40 s | 1,791 tok/s |

**Decode on prose**, by concurrent stream count:

| streams | TTFT | aggregate | per stream |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 418 ms | 36.9 tok/s | 36.9 tok/s |
| 2 | 445 ms | 57.4 tok/s | 29.7 tok/s |
| 4 | 550 ms | **85.9 tok/s** | 23.4 tok/s |

Decode speed on this model is **strongly content-dependent**, because MTP
speculative decoding accepts more drafts on predictable text. Measured on this
server: mean acceptance length 2.1 of a possible 4, per-position acceptance
0.65 / 0.33 / 0.14, average draft acceptance 37-41%. Highly predictable output
(quoting text back out of the context) reaches ~41 tok/s; dense technical prose
sits lower. Treat single-stream decode as a range rather than one number.


## Multimodal (images and video)

The checkpoint is multimodal (`is_multimodal: true`, `language_model_only:
false`, a 27-layer vision tower) and the launcher enables it by default —
nothing extra to configure. The vision tower is already counted in the
"weights on GPU" figure, so images and video cost no additional GPU budget.

Verified on this host 2026-09-04 against the running server:

| Modality | Test | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Image | 336x336 PNG, three colour bands | named all three in order; 179 prompt tokens |
| Video | 4 s clip, 16 frames, one colour per second | named all four **in temporal order**; 376 prompt tokens |

Use the standard OpenAI content-part shapes — `image_url` and `video_url`,
either an `http(s)://` URL or a `data:` URI:

```
curl -s localhost:8888/v1/chat/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
 "model":"qwen3.8-flash-next","max_tokens":600,"temperature":0,
 "messages":[{"role":"user","content":[
   {"type":"image_url","image_url":{"url":"https://example.com/photo.jpg"}},
   {"type":"text","text":"Describe this image."}]}]}'
```

Three things to know before leaning on it:

- **MTP speculative decoding degrades on multimodal requests.** The draft model
  cannot take multimodal embeddings, so vLLM logs `using text-only draft inputs
  instead` and falls back for those requests. The answer is still correct — the
  target model sees the image — but decode runs closer to the non-speculative
  speed. Text-only requests are unaffected.
- **Video is token-hungry.** Frame count and resolution drive prompt length
  fast. At `YARN=1` you have only 1.34x a full-length request in KV across
  `MAX_NUM_SEQS=4`, so concurrent video work contends; the 262k profile
  (2.81x) has far more headroom for it.
- **Long video at 512k is untested here.** The tests above were long-text *or*
  short-multimodal, never both at once.

## Configuration

Precedence is **environment > `.env` > built-in default in `start.sh`**, so any
knob can be overridden per launch:

```
MAX_MODEL_LEN=65536 MTP_NUM_SPECULATIVE_TOKENS=0 ./start.sh
```

The safety-relevant knobs are `KV_TARGET_GIB` (how much KV to target; the main
consumer of host memory) and `HOST_SLACK_GIB` (container cgroup cap = GPU
budget + this). `KV_TARGET_GIB=16` gives ~590k tokens and more host margin.

### Long context beyond 262k (YaRN)

The model's native context is 262,144. Going past it needs YaRN rope scaling,
which is off by default. The two lengths live side by side in `.env` and the
`YARN` flag alone picks which one is served:

```
YARN=0                     # 0 = native rope, 1 = YaRN
MAX_MODEL_LEN=262144       # served at YARN=0; cannot exceed native 262144
YARN_MAX_MODEL_LEN=524288  # served at YARN=1; ignored entirely at YARN=0
```

So `YARN=1` is the only edit needed to go to 512k, and flipping it back to `0`
returns to 262k without touching anything else. For a single launch:
`YARN=1 ./start.sh`.

`start.sh` derives the scaling factor itself (`YARN_MAX_MODEL_LEN / 262144`,
rounded up — 2.0 for 512k) and passes it to vLLM as a `--hf-overrides`
deep-merge into `text_config.rope_parameters`, which is the field this model
actually reads. The existing `mrope_section`, `rope_theta` and
`partial_rotary_factor` are preserved, so the attention path keeps the same
`MRotaryEmbedding` and mrope stays enabled.

512k fits with **no other change**: it needs 14.4 GiB of KV, well inside what
`KV_TARGET_GIB` provides at either 20 or the shipped 22, and the GPU budget and
cgroup cap are unchanged from 262k. Measured at `YARN=1`, BF16,
`KV_TARGET_GIB=20` (2026-09-04):

| | |
|---|---|
| Available KV cache | 19.2 GiB = **704,558 tokens** (1.34x a full 524,288 request) |
| Host MemAvailable idle | ~11.3 GiB |
| Output | coherent; MTP 3 and YaRN run together without incident |

At `KV_TARGET_GIB=22` with FP8 the same context gets 2.73x headroom instead of
1.34x — see [FP8 KV cache](#fp8-kv-cache-opt-in).

400k prefill stress test (salted to defeat prefix caching, needles planted at
5% / 50% / 95% depth):

| | |
|---|---|
| Prompt | 400,062 tokens |
| TTFT (prefill) | 260.3 s = **1,537 tok/s** |
| Needle retrieval | **3/3 PASS**, including 95% depth |
| Host MemAvailable low-water | **10.97 GiB** (watchdog floor is 6 GiB) |
| Peak container RSS | 18.7 GiB of the 103 GiB cap |

Decode measured 40 tok/s on that run, but the answer is three codes copied out
of the context — MTP's best case, not typical decode speed.

| Setting | Result |
|---|---|
| `YARN=1` | serves `YARN_MAX_MODEL_LEN`; `MAX_MODEL_LEN` is ignored (logged) |
| `YARN=0` with `MAX_MODEL_LEN` > 262144 | refused: tells you to set `YARN=1` |
| `YARN_MAX_MODEL_LEN` > `YARN_CEILING_MODEL_LEN` (524288) | refused: above the validated ceiling |
| `YARN=1` with `YARN_MAX_MODEL_LEN` at or below 262144 | warns, serves that length with native rope |
| 1M even with the ceiling raised | refused by the Step 2 budget check (cap 112 GiB vs 105 GiB ceiling) |

YaRN trades some short-context accuracy for the longer window, so leave it off
unless you need more than 262k. The 512k path serves correctly but its decode
and prefill speeds have not yet been benchmarked.

### Reasoning is on by default

This build reasons before answering, and `start.sh` passes
`--reasoning-parser qwen3`, so the thinking block arrives in a separate
`reasoning` field rather than inside `content`. The chat template enables it
whenever the flag is unset:

```jinja
{%- if enable_thinking is undefined or enable_thinking is true %}
```

Turn it off **per request** — no restart, so reasoning and non-reasoning
traffic can share one server:

```json
{"model":"qwen3.8-flash-next",
 "chat_template_kwargs":{"enable_thinking":false},
 "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"What is 17*23? One line."}]}
```

Measured on this host:

| | default | `enable_thinking: false` |
|---|---|---|
| reasoning tokens | 41 | **0** |
| completion tokens | 47 | **12** |
| `content` | `"\n\n391"` | `"17 * 23 = 391"` |

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **It is why `content` can come back empty.** With a small `max_tokens` the
  reply is often still inside its reasoning. Budget ~400+ tokens, or disable
  thinking. This is not a bug — see the sanity test above.
- **It dominates latency on simple work.** Reasoning ran to 4,841 tokens on the
  hardest task in our suite. For extraction, classification or short factual
  answers, disabling it is a large win; leave it on for anything that needs
  actual multi-step reasoning.

### FP8 KV cache (opt-in)

`KV_CACHE_DTYPE=fp8` roughly doubles the KV pool by storing the main KV in
fp8-e4m3 and dequantising each tile inside the QSA Triton kernels. **This is
the shipped default**, on the strength of the measurements below.

```
KV_CACHE_DTYPE=fp8    # ~2x KV pool, enables a 1M context (default)
KV_CACHE_DTYPE=auto   # BF16 KV, if you would rather not take the trade
```

Measured on this host 2026-09-04, identical prompts, `YARN=1`,
`KV_TARGET_GIB=22`, idle server:

All rows below are at matched settings (`KV_TARGET_GIB=22`, 512k YaRN) unless
noted. KV pool varies a little between restarts, so a range is given.

| | BF16 | FP8 | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| KV pool | 779,671–796,196 tok | **1,431,164–1,502,014 tok** | **~1.8–1.9x** |
| Concurrency @ 524,288 | 1.49–1.52x | **2.73–2.86x** | ~+85% |
| Prefill @400k | 1,537 tok/s | 1,495 tok/s | −2.7% |
| Prefill @32k (2 runs each) | 1,883 tok/s | 1,769 tok/s | −6.1% |
| Decode (prose, idle) | 28.3 tok/s (sd 2.6) | 27.1 tok/s (sd 1.3) | −4% |
| Reasoning suite (11 tasks) | **11/11** | **11/11** | same |
| Needle miss rate @32k | 2/14 (14%) | 5/20 (25%) | p=0.67, **n.s.** |

Only the 12 full-attention layers shrink (~84% of bytes/token); the QSA
side/compressor caches stay BF16, which is why the gain is ~1.85x rather than
2x, and why `KV_MULT` in `start.sh` is 0.58 rather than 0.5.

**The short-context penalty is real but small.** FP8 halves `block_n` to fit
GB10 shared memory, which costs more on a short kernel than a long one: −6.1%
at 32k versus −2.7% at 400k. That is far milder than the −30% the reference
implementation reported at 32k.

**On quality.** Both dtypes score 11/11 on the reasoning suite
(4 multi-step short tasks, 4 long chain-of-thought up to ~4,800 reasoning
tokens, 3 tasks combining three facts from a ~100k-token context). Both max it
out, so the honest reading is *no gross regression at n=11* — enough to rule
out the 6/6 → 2/6 collapse the reference measured, not enough to detect finer
drift. A suite everything passes cannot rank anything.

**A caution about needle tests on this model.** The 95%-depth needle at 32k is
flaky *regardless of KV dtype*: BF16 missed it 2/14 times, FP8 5/20, which
Fisher's exact test cannot distinguish (p=0.67). The two shallower needles were
found 34/34 times in both. So a single needle run is weak evidence here — an
isolated PASS or FAIL at 95% depth says little, and comparisons need matched
sample counts on both sides. The 3/3 results quoted elsewhere in this README
are single samples and should be read with that in mind.

**Two caveats before trusting these numbers.**

*The speed cost is measured at one point on the curve.* The reference
implementation (see credit below) reported **−30% prefill** and −9% decode,
against our −2.7% and −4%. That is very likely not a contradiction: their
prefill figure is at **32k**, ours at **400k**. FP8 halves `block_n` to fit
GB10 shared memory, which costs occupancy and launch overhead on a short
kernel but amortises away over a 400k context. **Short-context prefill with
FP8 has not been measured here and is probably materially worse than −2.7%.**

*Quality is not settled.* Needle retrieval passing at 5/50/95% depth shows the
scales and dequantisation are broadly right, and short factual/arithmetic
answers were correct. It does **not** clear the failure mode that matters: the
reference measured a long-reasoning benchmark falling from **6/6 to 2/6** with
FP8 KV. This is sparse attention — quantised keys perturb which blocks the
indexer selects, not merely the attention output — so degradation can appear
as fluent, plausible, wrong reasoning while needles still pass. No
long-reasoning A/B has been run on this host. Treat FP8 as a capacity trade
for workloads you have validated yourself.

### PLE mmap access pattern

The packed PLE table is advised `MADV_RANDOM` (in `patch_ple_offload.py`).
Without it the kernel faults in a ~64 KiB window to serve each 90-byte row
lookup. Measured on this host:

| | default mmap | `MADV_RANDOM` |
|---|---|---|
| Disk read per decoded token | ~1,366 KiB | **57 KiB** (−24x) |
| Decode | 26.3 tok/s (sd 1.6) | 28.3 tok/s (sd 2.6) |
| Host MemAvailable | ~10.9 GiB | **~12.95 GiB** |

The decode difference is within noise — decode was never disk-*throughput*
bound (1.4 MiB/token at 26 tok/s is only ~36 MB/s). The real win is the
~2 GiB of unified memory no longer wasted on readahead that is thrown away,
which is what makes `KV_TARGET_GIB=22` viable.

## Safety rules

Each of these cost a hard host hang during bring-up.

- **Keep host MemAvailable at or above ~10 GiB under load.** Exhausting the
  unified pool hangs the kernel with no OOM kill and no logs. `KV_TARGET_GIB`
  is the knob that eats it. The page cache is not spare memory — it is what
  keeps PLE lookups off NVMe.
- **`comfy-h3.service` must stay disabled.** It polls `127.0.0.1:8888` and
  launches ComfyUI (a GPU co-tenant) as soon as anything answers there.
  `start.sh` refuses port 8888 while that service is active.
- **Never set `PLE_OFFLOAD=false` at TP=1** — 99 GB through UVM hangs the host.
- **The stock QSA backend refuses FP8 KV** (`supported_kv_cache_dtypes =
  ["auto","bfloat16"]`). `patch_qsa_fp8_kv.py` in this repo adds it; without
  that patch `KV_CACHE_DTYPE=fp8` cannot work, and reading a quantised cache
  as BF16 would produce silent garbage rather than an error.
- **Do not raise `YARN_CEILING_MODEL_LEN` past 524288 at BF16.** A 1M context
  needs ~28.8 GiB of KV, driving the container cap to 112 GiB against a 105 GiB
  hard ceiling; `start.sh` refuses it at two independent checks. With
  `KV_CACHE_DTYPE=fp8` a 1M request needs only ~16.7 GiB and the budget does
  fit — but 1M has **never been run on this host**, at either dtype. Raising
  the ceiling means you are the one testing it.
- `docker --memory` does not bound GPU allocations on GB10, only host-side
  memory. vLLM's `--gpu-memory-utilization` is what bounds the GPU.

`files/memwatch.sh` runs alongside the container and kills it if MemAvailable
drops below `MEMWATCH_MIN_GIB` (default 6). Its log is under `logs/`.

## Sanity test

```
curl -s localhost:8888/v1/chat/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
 "model":"qwen3.8-flash-next","temperature":0,"max_tokens":400,
 "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"In one sentence, what is a DGX Spark?"}]}' \
 | python3 -c "
import json,sys
m=json.load(sys.stdin)['choices'][0]['message']
print('reasoning:', (m.get('reasoning') or '')[:200])
print('content  :', m.get('content'))"
```

This build emits reasoning **before** the answer, in a `reasoning` field rather
than `content`. Budget at least ~400 `max_tokens`: at 200 the reply is still
inside its reasoning, so `content` comes back empty on a perfectly healthy
server. Gibberish in either field means the PLE path has regressed (bf16 IPC
buffer or missing quant scales) — see the patch notes below.

## Layout

- `download.sh` — fetches the checkpoint into the Hugging Face cache
  (resumable; honours `HF_TOKEN` for gated repos). Uses the host's
  `huggingface_hub` if present, otherwise the container image.
- `start.sh` — launcher: derives the GPU budget from live memory,
  builds the packed PLE table on first run, regenerates the patched vLLM
  files, starts the container and `files/memwatch.sh`.
- `stop.sh` — stops the watchdog, then the container (gracefully by default);
  reports leftover `/dev/shm` segments without deleting them.
- `files/patch_ple_layer.py`, `files/patch_modelopt_mxfp8.py`,
  `files/patch_ple_offload.py` — generators that rewrite the patched vLLM
  files from pristine `*.orig` / `orig/` copies on **every** launch. Those
  copies are not in the repo — `start.sh` extracts them from the image on
  first run. Edit the generators; edits to the generated files are overwritten.
- `files/build_ple_packed_table.py` — one-time packed PLE table builder
  (27 GB output under `~/.cache/vllm/ple_cache/`, memory-mapped at runtime).

Benchmarks are not part of this repo. The published prefill and decode numbers
were measured with [sparkDash](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash).

## What is patched and why

- **PLE layer** (`patch_ple_layer.py`): NVFP4/FP8 dispatch for the PLE table;
  offloaded rows carry codes *and* scales (90 B/head); the GPU-side placeholder
  learns its quant method from config because its constructor is skipped under
  offload; tolerates multi-call `load_weights`; slices the 2560-wide IPC buffer
  to the 1440 valid bytes.
- **ModelOpt** (`patch_modelopt_mxfp8.py`): BF16 fallback for MXFP8 shapes that
  FlashInfer rejects.
- **PLE offload** (`patch_ple_offload.py`): GB10 has no CUDA stream memory ops
  (`CAN_USE_STREAM_MEM_OPS=0`, measured), and vLLM's offload semaphore used them
  and deadlocked after graph capture. Replaced with a host-side handshake — the
  GPU worker posts a request, the CPU worker copies and writes a sequence number
  to shared memory, the GPU worker proceeds. It also attaches the memory-mapped
  packed table instead of loading 27 GB into RAM. The mmap is advised
  `MADV_RANDOM`: without it the kernel faults in a ~64 KiB window to serve each
  90-byte row lookup, and measurements here showed **24x** more disk read per
  decoded token (1,366 -> 57 KiB/token) plus ~2 GiB of page cache wasted on
  readahead that is never used.
- **FP8 KV cache** (`patch_qsa_fp8_kv.py`, opt-in via `KV_CACHE_DTYPE=fp8`):
  dequantises each K/V tile inside the QSA Triton kernels with vLLM's
  `_cast_kv_tile`, plumbs `k_scale`/`v_scale` into the kernels, relaxes the
  four BF16-only guards and the inherited FlashAttention rejection, and halves
  `block_n` under quantisation. Raises the KV pool from ~800k to ~1.38M tokens,
  which is what makes a 1M context arithmetically possible on one Spark.
  **Off by default** and a real trade — see the warning `start.sh` prints.
