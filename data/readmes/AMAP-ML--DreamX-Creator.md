**DreamX-Creator 1.0** is a research framework for **native joint audio-video generation**. Given a first frame and a text prompt, its implemented base generator jointly models modality-specialized video and audio streams, using **Gated Cross-Modal Attention** and **Progressive Joint Training** to enable bidirectional audio-video interaction.

The broader system combines **Audio-Video Reinforcement Learning** with **Modality-Aware Multimodal Feedback** to improve visual and audio quality, semantic consistency, and fine-grained audio-video synchronization. **Autoregressive 1-Step 2K Refinement** then upgrades the generated video to high-quality 2K output while preserving content, motion, and audio-aligned timing.
