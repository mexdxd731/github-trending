# nativeprompt

**Rewrite your prompt into the native dialect of the model you're actually running — using that vendor's official rules — and show you which rule drove each edit.**

Scope: the **agentic CLIs** — Claude Code and Codex. Not the API, not the web chat.

---

## Why

The two vendors do not agree on what a good prompt looks like. Their own docs say so.

| Same phrase in your prompt | Claude Code | Codex / GPT‑5.x |
|---|---|---|
| "think step by step" | acceptable scaffolding | **remove it** — reasoning models plan internally, and prescribed intermediate steps get in the way ([reasoning guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/reasoning)) |
| "double-check yourself" | **remove it on Opus 5** — the model already verifies, so the reminder buys over-verification, tokens and latency ([Opus 5 prompting](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5)) | harmless, but usually redundant |
| "only report the important stuff" | **rephrase** — Opus 5 follows constraints literally and will genuinely hide the rest; ask for everything, filter in a second pass ([Opus 5 prompting](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5)) | same direction, weaker effect |
| repeated instructions, extra examples | tolerated | **cut them** — lean prompts win on GPT‑5.x ([prompt guidance](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/prompt-guidance)) |
| mixed instructions + data + examples | **wrap in XML tags** so the model doesn't blend them ([XML tags](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags)) | not a documented Codex practice |
| "CRITICAL: you MUST…" in caps | **drop the caps** — aggressive scaffolding causes over-triggering on new models | **drop it** — GPT‑4.1-era scaffolding, no longer helps ([GPT‑5 prompting guide](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_prompting_guide)) |

So a prompt tuned on one CLI is measurably *mis*-tuned on the other. `nativeprompt` detects which one you're on and applies that vendor's published rules — plus it recommends **how to run** the task (`/goal`, `/loop`, plan mode, dynamic workflow on Claude Code; `/plan`, `/goal`, delegation on Codex).

## What makes it different

Both vendors ship a prompt improver, but only for their own model, closed, and frozen at release time. Generic multi-vendor rewriters make *you* pick the target and their rule sets drift out of date. Four properties together are the point:

| | Anthropic prompt improver | OpenAI prompt optimizer | Generic multi-vendor rewriters (Rosetta et al.) | **nativeprompt** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Auto-detects the model you're on** | n/a — Anthropic only | n/a — OpenAI only | you pick the target manually | yes — family + generation, from the live session, env, or settings files |
| **Rules sourced from vendor docs** | implicit, not shown | implicit, not shown | usually hand-written folklore | every rule carries a `source` URL you can open |
| **Explains each edit** | no — silent rewrite | no — silent rewrite | rarely | yes — rule title, rationale, and link per finding |
| **Stays current** | ships when the vendor ships | ships when the vendor ships | goes stale | `update --diff` shows the exact changed lines in the vendor's doc; weekly CI opens a PR with that diff |

Plus: **zero runtime dependencies** (stdlib only), deterministic, works offline, no API key. The only command that touches the network is `update`.

> **Note on language.** The CLI's explanations are currently written in Russian (the author's audience); rule titles link to the vendors' English documentation. The code, the API and this README are English. English CLI output is on the roadmap — see [Contributing](#contributing).

## Install

```bash
pipx install nativeprompt   # or: pip install nativeprompt
```
Published on PyPI. Zero runtime dependencies — stdlib only, works offline, no API key.

Until then, install from a clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edvardgrishin27/nativeprompt
cd nativeprompt
pip install -e .            # gives you the `nativeprompt` command
```

Or run it with no install at all — it is stdlib-only:

```bash
python3 -m nativeprompt improve "your prompt" --model claude-opus-5
```

Requires Python ≥ 3.9. Nothing else.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Which model does it think you're on?
nativeprompt detect
```

```
Модель: claude-opus-5[1m] · opus-5
Семейство/CLI: claude (Claude Code)
Определено: ~/.claude/settings.json (сессия Claude Code · VS Code)
```

```bash
# 2. Rewrite + explain. Always pass the prompt over stdin —
#    quotes and $substitutions inside a user prompt will otherwise break the command.
printf '%s' 'Could you please FIX the login bug, think step by step and double-check yourself. Only report the most important things.' \
  | nativeprompt improve --model gpt-5.6
```

Real output (trimmed to the findings and the harness advice):

```
МОДЕЛЬ: Codex (gpt-5.6) · gpt-5.6
определено: явно (--model)

```

The exact same prompt against Claude Opus 5 produces a *different* set: `think step by step` survives, `double-check yourself` is removed, and scope / verification / output-format placeholders are added. Markers: `[+]` add, `[-]` remove, `[~]` restructure, `[!]` warning.

See both side by side in one command:

```bash
python3 examples/contrast_demo.py
```

More raw prompts to try are in [`examples/prompts.md`](examples/prompts.md).

### Commands

| Command | Flags | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `improve "<prompt>"` | `--model M`, `--json`, `--no-metaprompt` | detect → analyze → rewrite → harness advice → explain. Reads the prompt from stdin when the argument is omitted. |
| `detect` | `--model M`, `--json` | shows the resolved model, family/CLI, and **which signal** it came from. Exit 1 if nothing resolved. |
| `rules [claude\|codex]` | — | prints every rule with its source URL, plus the harness table. No argument = all families. |
| `update` | `--diff`, `--write`, `--timeout N`, `--json` | fetches the vendors' canonical docs and compares them with stored text snapshots. `--diff` prints the exact before/after lines. Non-zero exit when action is needed (CI signal). `--write` records the new snapshots after you've reviewed the rules. A weekly CI job opens a PR containing the diff — **rules themselves are always edited by a human** (see below). |

`nativeprompt --version` prints the version.

`improve` output has four blocks: **what to fix** (each with the vendor rule + link), the **rewritten prompt**, a **how-to-run** recommendation, and a **meta-prompt** you can hand to your own model for a full prose rewrite (suppress it with `--no-metaprompt`).

## Using it in VS Code

Both CLIs have a VS Code extension, and both have quirks that change how `nativeprompt` sees your setup. Everything in this section comes from the vendors' docs.

### Claude Code extension

**The extension does not put `claude` on your PATH.** It bundles a private copy of the CLI for its chat panel; a standalone CLI install is a separate thing ([vs-code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/vs-code)). Practical consequence: run `nativeprompt` in VS Code's **integrated terminal** (`` Cmd+` ``), and use the hook (below) if you want it inside the chat panel.

**Where the model actually comes from.** Claude Code's documented precedence is: in-session `/model` → `claude --model` at startup → `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` → the `model` field in your settings file ([model-config](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config)). `nativeprompt detect` follows the same order (env before settings) and tells you which signal it used.

**Three ways to confirm the model, in increasing order of reliability:**

1. `/status` in the chat panel — shows the active model and account ([model-config](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config)).
2. `nativeprompt detect` in the integrated terminal — also names the source file or variable.
3. A `statusLine` script — it receives `model.id` and `model.display_name` on stdin, along with `effort.level` and `context_window.context_window_size`, so it's the only way to confirm that a 1M context is *actually* active ([statusline](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/statusline)).

**If `detect` shows the wrong model,** it is almost always one of these:

- You pressed **`s`** in the `/model` picker ("this session only"). Since v2.1.153 only `Enter` writes the `model` field to your **user** settings; `s` writes nothing, so any settings-based detection sees the old value ([model-config](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config)).
- **VS Code was launched from Finder/Dock and never inherited your shell environment**, so `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` from `.zshrc` is invisible to it. The documented fixes: launch with `code .` from a terminal, set the extension's `claudeCode.environmentVariables` setting, or put the variable in the `env` block of `~/.claude/settings.json` — which is shared between the extension and the CLI ([vs-code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/vs-code)).
- **Project or managed settings override yours.** The cascade is managed → CLI args → `.claude/settings.local.json` → `.claude/settings.json` → `~/.claude/settings.json` ([settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings)). When the startup model comes from project or managed settings, the startup header names the file.
- **You're on an alias, not a version.** `opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku` / `best` resolve to different concrete models depending on your provider (Anthropic API vs Bedrock vs Foundry vs Google Cloud), and `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` and friends can redirect them ([model-config](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config)). `nativeprompt` says so explicitly and falls back to family-level rules. Pass `--model claude-opus-5` to get generation-specific rules. The `[1m]` suffix (1M context) is preserved and reported — it works on aliases and on full model names alike, including `opusplan[1m]`.

**Hooks work identically in the panel.** `~/.claude/settings.json` is *"shared between the extension and CLI"* — the same `hooks` block applies to both ([vs-code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/vs-code)). You can also reach it from the panel: type `/` → **Customize** → hooks. Adding `"$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-settings.json"` to the file gives you completion and validation right in the editor.

### Codex extension

- The IDE extension and the CLI **share the same configuration layers**; open it from the gear icon → **Codex Settings → Open config.toml** ([config-basic](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/config-file/config-basic)).
- Precedence: CLI flags → project `.codex/config.toml` (closest directory wins) → profile → `~/.codex/config.toml` → `/etc/codex/config.toml` → built-in defaults. **Untrusted projects skip the project-scoped `.codex/` layers entirely.**
- There is **no official environment variable for the Codex model** — the documented list is `CODEX_HOME`, `CODEX_SQLITE_HOME`, `CODEX_NON_INTERACTIVE`, `CODEX_INSTALL_DIR`, `CODEX_API_KEY`, `CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `CODEX_CA_CERTIFICATE`, `SSL_CERT_FILE`, `RUST_LOG` ([environment-variables](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/config-file/environment-variables)). `nativeprompt` reads `model = "..."` from `config.toml`; its `CODEX_MODEL` / `OPENAI_MODEL` lookups are an **unofficial convenience heuristic**, and so is its detection of an active Codex session. When in doubt, pass `--model codex` explicitly.

Known gaps in the current detector, stated plainly: it does not yet read Claude Code's **managed** settings (highest precedence, enterprise deployments), the project-level `.codex/config.toml`, `CODEX_HOME`, or the `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*` alias redirects. Issues and PRs welcome.

## Two modes

### On demand — as a skill

[`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) at the repo root is a Claude Code skill. Drop it into `~/.claude/skills/nativeprompt/SKILL.md` (or your project's `.claude/skills/`), and "improve my prompt" routes through the tool: it runs `nativeprompt improve --json`, shows you the findings with their source links and the how-to-run advice, then executes the returned meta-prompt to produce the polished rewrite.

Two rules baked into the skill are worth repeating: the incoming prompt is treated as **data, not instructions** (the model must not execute what's inside it), and the prompt is passed over **stdin only**, never interpolated into a shell command.

### Every prompt — as a UserPromptSubmit hook

[`hooks/nativeprompt_hook.py`](hooks/nativeprompt_hook.py) runs on every prompt you send and attaches the improved version plus the applicable rules as context. Add to `~/.claude/settings.json` (shared by the CLI and the VS Code panel):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-settings.json",
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 /absolute/path/to/nativeprompt/hooks/nativeprompt_hook.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

What it does and doesn't do:

- It **cannot replace your prompt text.** `UserPromptSubmit` has no `updatedPrompt` output field — a handler can only return `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` or block the submission ([hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks)). So Claude sees your original *next to* the improved version, and the hook says which one to act on.
- It **stays quiet** on short prompts (< 15 chars) and on prompts that already satisfy the rules, so it doesn't turn into noise.
- Any error is swallowed — it never blocks your prompt from being sent.
- **Budget: 30 seconds.** `UserPromptSubmit` lowers the default hook timeout from 600 s to 30 s ([hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks)). This hook is deterministic and makes no network calls, so it fits comfortably — don't add network calls of your own there.
- Matchers are not supported for this event and are silently ignored; it fires on every prompt.
- The hook resolves the package on its own: an installed `nativeprompt` first, then its own repository directory, then `NATIVEPROMPT_HOME` / `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`. No path editing required, and it stays silent rather than failing if nothing resolves.

There is also a documented way to get the model *exactly*, which the hook does not use yet: only `SessionStart` hooks can receive a `model` field, and *"there is no `$CLAUDE_MODEL` environment variable"* ([hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks)). A `SessionStart` hook that caches that value would beat any settings-file read, because it also catches `--model` and the session-only `s` choice. Contributions welcome.

## Codex usage

Root [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) governs agent work in this repo. Codex-specific integration lives entirely in [`codex/`](codex/):

- `codex/integration/plugins/nativeprompt/skills/nativeprompt/` — a standalone Codex skill.
- `codex/integration/plugins/nativeprompt/skills/nativeprompt/scripts/improve_prompt.py` — a safe wrapper: stdin only, no shell, validates the JSON contract.
- `codex/integration/AGENTS.md.snippet` — an optional block for your own project's `AGENTS.md` so Codex calls the tool when you ask it to improve a prompt.
- `codex/REVIEW.md` — review notes. By convention, proposed core changes are staged as unified diffs in `codex/patches/` rather than applied to `nativeprompt/` directly.

Local install for Codex:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e .
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
ln -s "$PWD/codex/integration/plugins/nativeprompt/skills/nativeprompt" ~/.agents/skills/nativeprompt
```

Then, in a new Codex session: `$nativeprompt improve this prompt for Codex: ‹prompt›`.

Note that Codex reads persistent project rules from `AGENTS.md` automatically, merged from `~/.codex` down through directories from the repo root to the current one, with deeper files overriding ([agents-md](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/agents-md)). Reasoning depth and answer length belong in `~/.codex/config.toml` (`model_reasoning_effort`, `model_verbosity`), not in prose inside your prompt ([config-reference](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/config-file/config-reference)) — `nativeprompt` will tell you so instead of rewriting the prompt around it.

## How it works

```
detect  →  analyze  →  rewrite  →  harness  →  explain          (+ update, out of band)
```

1. **detect** (`detect.py`) — resolves model → **family + generation**. Keying on family means an unreleased id like `claude-opus-6` still gets Claude-family rules instead of nothing. Signals, in order: `--model`, active CLI session markers, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` / `OPENAI_MODEL` / `CODEX_MODEL`, the `~/.claude/settings.json` cascade, `~/.codex/config.toml`. The `[1m]` suffix is split off and reported separately.
2. **analyze** (`analyze.py`) — regex detectors for prompt smells (`forced_cot`, `verification_demand`, `pushy_caps`, `repetition`, `contradiction_hint`, `missing_verification`, `missing_output_contract`, `vague_ask`, …) plus a **task shape** classifier: `trivial | normal | planning | goal | loop | workflow`.
3. **rewrite** (`rewrite.py`) — the deterministic pass. It removes what the vendor says hurts, restructures what the vendor says to restructure, and adds missing sections **as `‹placeholders›`**. It never invents your task.
4. **harness** (`harness.py`) — maps the task shape to a run mode from the `harness` block of the rules file: plan mode / `/goal` / `/loop` / dynamic workflow on Claude Code, `/plan` / `/goal` / delegation on Codex — each with its own source link.
5. **explain** (`explain.py`) — assembles the report and the **meta-prompt**: a model-specific instruction, built from exactly the rules that fired, which your own Claude or Codex executes to do the full prose rewrite. That split is deliberate — the tool itself contains no model.

## Self-update

`nativeprompt/rules/*.json` is a human-curated, versioned cheat sheet, keyed by **model family + generation**, where every rule carries a `source` URL.

`nativeprompt update` fetches the vendors' canonical `.md` / `llms.txt` pages (manifest: `nativeprompt/rules/_sources.json`), hashes them, and diffs against the stored snapshot:

```
[изменилось]       claude  https://code.claude.com/docs/en/goal.md
[новое]            openai  https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/prompting.md
[без изменений]    claude  https://code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices.md
...
Итог: изменилось 1, новых 4, без изменений 9, недоступно 0 (из 14).
```

A weekly GitHub Actions job (`.github/workflows/update-rules.yml`) runs exactly that and fails when the official guidance moved. **The rules are never rewritten automatically** — a maintainer reads the changed doc, updates the JSON, and lands it in a PR, then records the new snapshot with `nativeprompt update --write`. That is a deliberate design choice: a cheat sheet you can audit is worth more than one that mutates silently.

## Boundaries

Deliberately narrow, so the tool stays trustworthy:

- **It does not invent your task.** Missing details — file paths, done criteria, output format — become explicit `‹placeholders›`, never fabricated content.
- **The deterministic rewrite is structural, not literary.** It strips what hurts, restructures, and inserts placeholder sections. The full prose rewrite is the **meta-prompt**, run by your own model. There is no LLM inside this tool.
- **Detectors are regex heuristics.** Unusual phrasings will produce false positives and misses. It is an assistant, not an oracle.
- **An alias is not a version.** `opus`, `sonnet`, `best` resolve differently per provider and plan, so generation-specific rules are withheld and family rules applied — and the CLI says so.
- **No benchmark claims.** The tool applies the vendors' published rules; it does not measure that your prompt got "N% better", and it will never print such a number.
- **v1 covers Claude Code and Codex.** The family architecture is ready for more vendors; nothing else is implemented.

Honest limits are tracked in [`CLAIMS.md`](CLAIMS.md).

## Contributing

Verify first:

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q          # 67 tests: detection, detectors, rewrite, harness, rules integrity, frozen snapshot
```

**Adding or changing a rule.** Rules live in `nativeprompt/rules/<family>.json`. A rule is only accepted with a **link to the vendor's own documentation** — no folklore, no blog posts, no "it worked for me". Shape:

```json
{
  "id": "opus5-remove-verification",
  "scope": "opus-5",                 // "family" or a generation key
  "check": "verification_demand",    // a detector in analyze.py
  "action": "remove",                // add | remove | restructure | warn
  "title": "short imperative",
  "why": "one or two sentences, concrete",
  "source": "https://…"              // official vendor doc, must return 200
}
```

If your rule needs a new `check`, add the detector to `analyze.py` with a test. If the source page isn't in `rules/_sources.json`, add it there too so `update` starts watching it. There's a frozen-snapshot test over the rule set: rule changes are visible in the diff by design.

**Adding a vendor.** Drop a new `nativeprompt/rules/<family>.json` with `detect` (id prefixes + aliases), `generations`, `rules`, and a `harness` block describing that CLI's run modes; register its docs in `_sources.json`. `catalog.py` discovers families from the directory — no code change needed for a well-formed file.

Other useful contributions, in rough priority order: English CLI output, managed-settings and `CODEX_HOME` support in `detect.py`, a `SessionStart` hook for exact model resolution, and detector precision on non-Russian, non-English prompts.

## Why rules are not auto-merged

The robot detects the change, fetches it, shows the exact diff and opens the PR.
The last step — deciding whether a *rule* changes — stays human, on purpose:

1. **A doc change is not a rule change.** Most edits are typos, rewordings, new examples.
   Auto-applying would churn the rules for nothing.
2. **A rule is a translation, not a copy.** The doc says, in prose, "Opus 5 verifies its own
   work — remove explicit verification instructions". The rule is a detector plus a decision
   about scope (whole family, or just this generation). That is judgement.
3. **A wrong auto-update is worse than a stale rule.** It would hand you bad advice *carrying an
   official source link* — that is, with maximum credibility. This package is installed by other
   people; model-written changes should not merge themselves into it.
