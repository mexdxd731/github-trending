# Crepitus Protocol

> **Status: unaudited testnet research. Do not use with real funds.**

Crepitus is an experimental EVM protocol project exploring collateralized synthetic assets. The repository is being built in verifiable milestones; features are documented as available only after their source code and tests are committed.

## What exists now

- `CREPToken.sol`: capped ERC-20 prototype with permit support and role-based minting.
- `MockOracle.sol`: mutable local/testnet oracle with 8-decimal prices.
- Hardhat 3 contract compilation, TypeScript tests, and Ignition deployment.
- React status page.
- GitHub Actions checks.

## What does not exist yet

Collateral custody, debt accounting, liquidation, synthetic-equity issuance, production oracle integrations, route reserves, governance, audits, and mainnet deployments are not implemented.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22.13.0 or newer
- npm 10 or newer

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

Commit the generated `package-lock.json`. After that, CI and fresh clones should use:

```bash
npm ci
```

## Verify the repository

```bash
npm run check
npm run audit:runtime
```

The first command runs linting, Solidity compilation, TypeScript checking, contract tests, and the frontend production build. The second checks production/runtime dependencies for high-severity advisories.

## Local frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Local simulated deployment

```bash
npm run contracts:deploy:local
```

## Sepolia deployment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, enter test-only credentials, and run:

```bash
npm run contracts:deploy:sepolia
```

Never use a wallet that controls real funds. Values prefixed with `VITE_` are public browser configuration and must never contain secrets.
