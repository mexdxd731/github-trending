A visualization tool that replays coding-agent sessions on a 3D map of your codebase.

*The 30-second demo — sound on.*

## The problem

A session log records what an agent did, but not how it understood the task:
which parts of the repo it treated as relevant, where it explored before it
acted, whether its footprint matched the scope you had in mind. Reading the
raw JSONL line by line doesn't answer any of that.

## The idea

Draw the repository as a night map, and play the session back as light moving
through it: where the agent searched, read, and edited, the map glows —
everything else stays dark. The agent's understanding of the task becomes a
shape you can see at a glance. One Go binary reads Claude Code and Codex
session logs, fully local; viewing sends nothing anywhere. The one exception
is the optional session evaluation: when you explicitly run it, a summary of
that session (task wording, file paths, event digests) is sent to the model
behind your own `claude` or `codex` CLI — see
[Session evaluation](#session-evaluation).

## Quick start

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmtrek/mindwalk/master/scripts/install.sh | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
mindwalk
```

The installer verifies the binary against `checksums.txt` and installs to
`~/.local/bin` (override with `INSTALL_DIR`; pin a release with `VERSION`).
Windows archives are on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cosmtrek/mindwalk/releases).
To build from source: `make setup && make build` → `bin/mindwalk`.

With no arguments, mindwalk scans `~/.claude/projects` and `~/.codex/sessions`,
serves the UI on a random local port, and opens a browser:

```text
mindwalk serve [--port N] [--no-open] [--claude-dir DIR] [--codex-dir DIR]
mindwalk open [--no-open] <session.jsonl>   open one specific session
mindwalk build <repo> [-o out]              write the repository citymap JSON
mindwalk trace <session> [-o out]           write the normalized trace JSON
mindwalk analyze <session> [--judge claude|codex] [--model name]
                                            evaluate one session (see below)
```

## Reading the picture

- **Tree / Terrain views** — the repo as a radial tree or a treemap plain;
  glow ∝ how deeply and how often a file was touched.
- **Touch states** — each file keeps its deepest touch: seen (moss green),
  read (moon white), edited (warm amber), unvisited (dark). The HUD folds
  friction signals — error rate, churned files, edits after the last verify —
  into a review strip.
- **Playback deck** — scrub or play the session over a bucketed histogram of
  the run. Bars sit on a cool/warm spectrum: observation stays cool (search,
  read, exec), mutation glows warm (edit, verify), so editing phases jump out
  at a glance.
- **Timeline marks** — `◇` context compactions, `○` subagent launches,
  `›` user turns; every mark is a click-to-jump target.
- **Inspector** — click a file to pin its visit history; click a visit row to
  jump the playhead to that moment.
- **Evaluate** — ask a local agent CLI to judge the session's trajectory;
  session rows carry the evaluation state as a quiet badge. See
  [Session evaluation](#session-evaluation).

Keyboard: `Space` play/pause · `←`/`→` step (`⇧` ×10) · `Home`/`End` ends ·
`S` speed · `E` next edit · `X` next error · `M` next mark · `⌘B` session rail.

## Session evaluation

The evaluate panel (and `mindwalk analyze`) asks a local agent CLI to judge
how the session went — exploration, scope, wandering, verification — with
every finding anchored to timeline events you can click through to. Pick the
judge (any installed CLI) and its model in the panel; the report records who
actually judged.

**What leaves your machine, and only when you ask:** evaluation runs your own
`claude` or `codex` CLI, which sends that session's summary — the user
messages' wording, file paths, and one-line event digests — to the model
behind your account. Nothing is sent while viewing sessions, and no other
session is included. The judge subprocess runs sealed: no tools, no MCP
servers, no user or project settings, and no session persistence.

Reports are cached in `~/.mindwalk/reports`, one per session; a report goes
stale (never auto-reruns) when the session's content changes.

## Under the hood

Three artifacts, kept deliberately separate:

1. a **trace** — the session log normalized into an ordered stream of
   file-touch events (`internal/adapter`, one adapter per agent format);
2. a **citymap** — a deterministic layout of the repository
   (`internal/citymap`); the same tree always produces the same map, so
   replays are comparable across sessions;
3. a **report** — an LLM judge's evidence-anchored findings about one
   session (`internal/judge`); the judge only contributes findings, verdicts
   are always rolled up mechanically, so reports stay comparable too.

A local Go server (`internal/server`) joins them and serves the
React/Three.js frontend (`web`). `schema/` mirrors the exported JSON contracts.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. To get a working dev setup:

```sh
make setup   # install frontend dependencies
make serve   # dev server on :8765, serving web/dist from the working tree
make test    # go test + frontend build — run before sending a PR
make build   # regenerate embedded assets and bin/mindwalk
```

Ground rules (see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full architecture notes):

- Keep the boundaries: adapters don't know about rendering, citymap generation
  doesn't depend on playback, the judge reads only the normalized trace, and
  the server just connects the pieces.
- Keep Go code `gofmt`-ed; never hand-edit `internal/server/static` —
  regenerate it with `make build`.
- When trace, citymap, or report JSON shapes change, update `schema/` and the
  relevant tests in the same change.
