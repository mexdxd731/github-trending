<h1 align="center">ENCORE</h1>

ENCORE is a guided Wine compatibility setup for running Ableton Live 12 Suite on Linux. It is maintained by `wowitsjack` and focuses on making the difficult parts, including installing a verified patched Wine runtime, configuring HiDPI, native file access, VST3 hosting, audio, drag-and-drop, themed menus, and Learn View, approachable from one command.

> [!WARNING]
> ENCORE is experimental and is not affiliated with Ableton or Wine. Back up important Live Sets and prefixes before testing it.

### Before you start

You need:

- an x86-64 PC running Ubuntu 22.04 or newer, Debian 12 or newer, Fedora, Arch Linux, or CachyOS;
- about 3.5 GiB of free space, plus the size of your Ableton installation;
- an internet connection for dependencies and the first WebView2 setup;
- permission to use sudo if ENCORE needs to install missing system packages;
- the complete **already-installed** `Live 12 Suite` folder from your own licensed Windows installation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The downloaded Ableton installer is not enough. Install Live on Windows first, or extract your licensed installed copy another way, then copy the complete outer `Live 12 Suite` folder to Linux. See [the required folder layout](#supplying-ableton-live).

### Install in five steps

1. Click the **Download ENCORE v0.1.0** button above.
2. Open your Downloads folder and extract the `.tar.xz` archive.
3. Move the extracted `ENCORE-v0.1.0-linux-x86_64` folder somewhere permanent and writable. A good choice is an `Applications` folder inside your Home folder; create it if it does not exist.
4. Open ENCORE in its permanent location, right-click an empty area, and choose **Open in Terminal**.
5. Paste this command and press Enter:

```sh
./install.sh
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The extracted ENCORE folder is the application, not a disposable installer. Keep it in that permanent location after setup. Moving or deleting it later breaks the Wine runtime, Ableton prefix, logs, and application-menu entry.

If your file manager does not offer **Open in Terminal**, open the Terminal app, type `cd ` with a space after it, drag the permanent ENCORE folder into the terminal, press Enter, then run `./install.sh`.

The friendly setup wizard checks your system, shows any package command before asking for sudo, asks you to select the installed Ableton folder, recommends a display scale, creates an application-menu entry, and can launch Live when setup is finished.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not run `sudo ./install.sh`. Run it as your normal user. ENCORE asks for sudo only when you approve installation of missing system packages.

If setup is interrupted, run `./install.sh` again. ENCORE safely reuses completed steps and tells you where to find its logs if something fails.

## Features

- Drag files and audio directly from Nautilus and compatible desktop file managers into Live.
- Corrected internal drag-and-drop positioning under Wine and Xwayland.
- Windows VST3 plug-in scanning and hosting, including resizable custom plug-in windows with working mouse input.
- VST3 custom folders anywhere the user selects, including mounted drives, through the native desktop folder picker.
- Audio through Wine's PulseAudio backend on both PulseAudio systems and PipeWire systems using `pipewire-pulse`.
- Guided HiDPI scaling, themed application menus, WebView2 Learn View support, and dynamic CPU topology selection.
- Application-menu integration for GNOME, KDE, and other desktops that support freedesktop desktop entries.

## Supplying Ableton Live

ENCORE does not download, run, or bundle the Ableton installer. To create a new prefix, supply the complete `Live 12 Suite` application folder from an existing Windows installation. On a normal Windows installation, this is `C:\ProgramData\Ableton\Live 12 Suite`. You may instead supply the same complete application folder if you obtained it by extracting your own licensed copy another way.

Select the outer `Live 12 Suite` folder:

```text
Live 12 Suite/
├── Program/
│   ├── Ableton Live 12 Suite.exe
│   └── Ableton Live Engine.dll
├── Resources/
├── Redist/
└── Legal/
```

Do not select the folder containing the downloaded Ableton installer, the installer archive itself, a lone `.exe`, or only the inner `Program` subfolder. Those are not the complete installed application folder and ENCORE rejects them.

ENCORE copies the complete folder into its Wine prefix, validates the copy before activating it, then runs the Visual C++ and WebView2 setup programs retained under `Redist`. The small WebView2 bootstrapper downloads the actual runtime, so a fresh prefix needs an internet connection during this step. ENCORE does not reproduce unrelated Windows shell associations or device-driver registration.

Allow free space for the complete Live folder plus about 3.5 GiB for staging, the Wine prefix, Visual C++, and WebView2. ENCORE measures the selected folder and checks the destination before it starts copying.

## Binary releases

Each release publishes four files:

- `ENCORE-v0.1.0-linux-x86_64.tar.xz`: the recommended turnkey package with ENCORE and Wine ready to use;
- `encore-wine-11.13-r1-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.xz`: the runtime-only asset used by the setup script;
- `encore-wine-11.13-r1-source.tar.xz`: the complete corresponding patched Wine source and build instructions;
- `SHA256SUMS`: checksums for all three archives.

The runtime uses an x86-64 Unix host build plus Wine's combined i386 and x86-64 Windows PE support. This lets the 64-bit Live application and its retained 32-bit prerequisite installers run in one prefix. It is built on Ubuntu 22.04 against glibc 2.35, stripped, audited for absolute build paths and unsafe runtime search paths, then smoke-tested on Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch Linux. Graphics drivers, audio services, desktop portals, and glibc remain supplied by the user's distribution so the bundle can work with the host desktop and GPU.

ENCORE compiles upstream Wine 11.13 NTSync support. It uses `/dev/ntsync` when the running kernel provides it and falls back to normal Wine server synchronization when it does not. ENCORE does not currently add Proton or Wine-GE Fsync patches.

## Supported systems

- x86-64 Linux.
- Ubuntu 22.04 or newer and Debian 12 or newer through `apt`.
- Fedora through `dnf`/`dnf5`.
- Arch Linux and CachyOS through `pacman`.
- A Wayland session with Xwayland available is recommended.

GNOME on Wayland is the best-tested desktop. The package setup supports KDE and other desktops, including their portal backends, but ENCORE's window-management compatibility work is still experimental there.

On Arch and CachyOS, approving dependency installation runs `pacman -Syu` because partial upgrades are unsupported. The wizard shows the command before invoking sudo.

The binary runtime is roughly 50 MiB compressed and about 300 MiB after extraction. An optional `--build-from-source` build still needs roughly 15–25 GiB of free space and can use substantial CPU.

## Display scaling

The wizard recommends a value from the current desktop and monitor when it can. You always get the final choice:

| Desktop scale | Wine DPI |
| --- | ---: |
| 100% | 96 |
| 125% | 120 |
| 150% | 144 |
| 175% | 168 |
| 200% | 192 |
| 250% | 240 |

For mixed-DPI monitors, choose the scale of the monitor where Ableton normally opens. You can rerun `./install.sh --no-build` later to change it safely.

## Existing installations and retries

If the selected prefix already contains a complete Ableton installation, the wizard offers to reuse it. A matching verified runtime is reused offline. Interrupted runtime downloads resume safely, and optional source builds resume through Make. ENCORE never deletes a dirty Wine checkout, an unrelated prefix, or completed work.

Once setup begins, detailed logs are stored under `logs/`. A failure reports the stage, log path, and safely quoted retry command. Fix the stated problem and rerun it; completed safe stages are retained. If a Live source folder was supplied but the selected prefix already contains a complete copy, ENCORE reuses the existing copy unless `--replace-live` is explicit. Replacement is staged and validated before the old folder is swapped out.

Live must be closed while ENCORE changes the prefix. In interactive mode the wizard waits for you to close it. It never kills Live or injects remote input.

## Automation and advanced paths

Run `./install.sh --help` for every option. A fully specified unattended install looks like:

```sh
./install.sh --non-interactive --yes --install-deps \
  --live-dir "/path/to/Live 12 Suite" \
  --scale 200 --no-launch
```

Useful alternatives:

```sh
./install.sh --dry-run
./install.sh --build-from-source --build-only --install-deps --jobs 4
./install.sh --no-build --dpi 96
./install.sh --prefix "$HOME/Music/Ableton Prefix"
```

ENCORE refuses to modify a non-empty prefix it does not recognize. Inspect the folder first, then pass `--adopt-prefix` only when you deliberately want ENCORE to own it.

The wizard remembers the selected prefix, Wine, and Ableton paths in `.encore/runtime.conf`, so later setup runs and the bare launcher keep working with custom locations and with `--no-desktop`. Environment variables and command-line options override those saved choices. Setup and launcher variables include:

- `ABLETON_LIVE_DIR`: complete Windows-installed `Live 12 Suite` source folder for a new import.
- `ENCORE_PREFIX`: Wine prefix; defaults to `ableton-prefix`.
- `ENCORE_WINE`: existing ENCORE Wine executable.
- `ENCORE_ABLETON`: Ableton executable path inside the prefix.
- `ENCORE_CPU_TOPOLOGY`: runtime CPU topology override. The default is selected from the Linux affinity/cpuset and capped at eight logical CPUs.
- `ENCORE_WEBVIEW2_FLAGS`: complete WebView2 flag override. Set it to an empty value to disable launcher-supplied flags.

Live's **Settings > Plug-ins > VST3 Custom Folder > Browse** control uses the native desktop folder picker. ENCORE exposes the selected host path to Live and its plug-in scanner, including folders outside your home directory and folders on mounted drives. No symlink or VST path variable is required.

## Known limitations

- GNOME/Wayland/Xwayland is the primary tested window-management path; other desktops remain experimental.
- WebView2 currently requires `--no-sandbox` under this Wine build, weakening isolation for the remote Learn View page.
- DirectComposition is disabled; Learn View uses SwiftShader and CPU compositing.
- Binary releases currently target x86-64 Linux. ARM64 and 32-bit Wine builds are not provided.

## Bug reports and next steps

We love bug reports. ENCORE covers an unusual mix of Wine, desktop integration, audio, plug-ins, graphics, and hardware, so real-world reports are one of the best ways to make it better. If something breaks, [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/wowitsjack/ENCORE/issues) with your Linux distribution, desktop/session, GPU, the steps that trigger the problem, and the relevant ENCORE log. Please remove personal information and do not upload Ableton installers, installed Ableton application files, Live content, or other licensed files.

The next areas of development are:

- Ableton Push support, including reliable discovery and communication with Push hardware;
- broader USB and MIDI setup, permissions, and hot-plug handling across supported distributions;
- continued compatibility work for plug-ins, WebView2, graphics, audio, and non-GNOME desktops.

## Licensing and bundled material

ENCORE does not redistribute Ableton software. `patches/encore-wine.patch` is a source delta against the pinned upstream Wine revision and remains subject to the applicable upstream file licenses. Binary releases include Wine's license and notices inside the runtime plus the complete corresponding patched Wine source as a separate release asset.

ENCORE does not ship a replacement font binary. It creates a prefix-local Arial-compatible fallback from the user's installed Liberation Sans, retains the source font's license records, and records the source hash in the generated font metadata.
