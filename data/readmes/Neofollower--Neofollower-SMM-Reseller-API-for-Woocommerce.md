# Neofollower – SMM Reseller API for WooCommerce

This free, GPL-licensed plugin is designed for agencies, social media service resellers, and WooCommerce store owners who want to sell selected NeoFollower services through a normal WordPress + WooCommerce storefront instead of operating a separate SMM panel interface.

## What does this WordPress SMM reseller plugin do?

Neofollower – SMM Reseller API for WooCommerce turns selected WooCommerce products into API-fulfilled social media service products.

A store administrator can synchronize the NeoFollower service catalog, connect a WooCommerce product to a service, collect the public target information required for fulfillment, and automatically submit an eligible paid WooCommerce order to NeoFollower. The plugin stores the external order ID and can synchronize fulfillment status back into WooCommerce.

Typical use cases include:

- WooCommerce-based SMM reseller stores
- Social media marketing agencies selling services through WordPress
- Existing WooCommerce stores adding selected reseller services
- Stores that want WooCommerce checkout and payment gateways with API-based fulfillment
- Resellers who prefer a normal e-commerce storefront over a dedicated SMM panel UI

## Features

- Connect individual WooCommerce products to synchronized NeoFollower services.
- Synchronize the NeoFollower service catalog from the reseller API.
- Collect a public profile, post, page, channel, username, or other configured target field.
- Support fixed quantity and customer-selected quantity products.
- Support custom-comment services.
- Support package services that do not require quantity.
- Support drip-feed orders with runs and interval values.
- Automatically submit eligible paid WooCommerce orders.

- Prevent duplicate external submissions with per-order-item locking.
- Synchronize active external order statuses automatically or manually.
- Display fulfillment status with WooCommerce order information.
- Monitor NeoFollower account balance.
- Send optional low-balance and failed-fulfillment email alerts.
- Optionally pause new fulfillment below a configured balance threshold.
- Maintain configurable diagnostic logs.
- Optionally remove plugin data during uninstall.

| Requirement | Minimum |
|---|---:|
| WordPress | 6.2 |
| WooCommerce | 6.0 |
| PHP | 7.4 |
| NeoFollower account | Required |

## Installation

### From WordPress.org

The recommended installation method is the official WordPress Plugin Directory:

https://wordpress.org/plugins/neofollower-smm-reseller-api-for-woocommerce/

In WordPress:

### WP-CLI

```bash
wp plugin install neofollower-smm-reseller-api-for-woocommerce --activate
```

### Manual ZIP installation

Download a stable release ZIP from WordPress.org, then use:

**Plugins → Add New Plugin → Upload Plugin**

See the full [installation guide](docs/installation.md).

## Basic setup

After activation, go to:

```text
WooCommerce → Neofollower
```

The administration area provides controls for:

- API configuration
- connection testing
- service synchronization
- balance monitoring
- external order records
- status synchronization
- logs
- support / bug reporting

Then edit a WooCommerce product and enable NeoFollower fulfillment for that product.

See [configuration](docs/configuration.md).

## How order fulfillment works

At a high level:

```text
Customer selects configured WooCommerce product
                  ↓
Customer enters target / quantity / comments when required
                  ↓
WooCommerce checkout and payment
                  ↓
Plugin detects eligible paid order
                  ↓
Plugin locks the order item against duplicate submission
                  ↓
POST request to NeoFollower reseller API
                  ↓
NeoFollower order ID saved to WooCommerce
                  ↓
Scheduled or manual status synchronization
                  ↓
Updated fulfillment status shown in WooCommerce
```

The plugin listens to eligible WooCommerce payment/order events and submits only products that have NeoFollower fulfillment enabled.

Read [how fulfillment works](docs/how-it-works.md).

## Supported fulfillment types

The current plugin supports these integration modes:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Standard | Target + quantity |
| Customer quantity | Customer selects quantity within configured limits |
| Custom comments | Target + comment lines |
| Package | Target without quantity |
| Drip feed | Target + quantity + runs + interval |

Actual service availability and field requirements depend on the live NeoFollower service catalog.

## NeoFollower API integration

The plugin communicates with:

```text
https://panel.neofollower.com/api/v1
```

using WordPress `wp_remote_post()`.

Core API actions used by the plugin include:

```text
services
balance
add
status
```

The API key and request payload are sent server-side. The plugin does not expose the NeoFollower API key to normal storefront visitors.

For the API itself, see:

- https://panel.neofollower.com/api/docs
- the official NeoFollower API GitHub repository when published

## Architecture

The plugin is deliberately small and uses WordPress/WooCommerce APIs directly.

### `NFWC_Plugin`

Initializes the plugin, declares WooCommerce compatibility, schedules recurring tasks, adds privacy-policy text, and manages balance monitoring.

### `NFWC_API`

Handles server-side communication with the NeoFollower reseller API using `wp_remote_post()`.

### `NFWC_Admin`

Provides the **WooCommerce → Neofollower** administration interface and administrator actions such as testing the API, synchronizing services, checking balance, retrying orders, and viewing logs.

### `NFWC_Product`

Adds NeoFollower fulfillment settings to WooCommerce products and collects the service-specific customer input used for fulfillment.

### `NFWC_Order`

Submits eligible paid order items, applies duplicate-submission locking, stores external order IDs, synchronizes statuses, and manages failure notifications.

### `NFWC_DB`

Creates and manages the plugin's service, fulfillment-order, and log tables plus plugin settings.

More detail is available in the [developer guide](docs/developer-guide.md).

## Data stored by the plugin

Depending on configuration and order type, the plugin can store:

- NeoFollower service IDs
- NeoFollower external order IDs
- public target links or usernames
- quantities
- custom comments
- drip-feed settings
- fulfillment statuses
- API response information
- diagnostic logs

The plugin also stores the API key in WordPress settings for server-side API communication.

See [privacy and security](docs/privacy-security.md).

## External service disclosure

NeoFollower provides the remote service required for catalog synchronization, balance checks, external order placement, and fulfillment status synchronization.

Depending on the action and service type, requests can include the NeoFollower API key, service ID, public target, username, quantity, comments, drip-feed data, or NeoFollower order ID.

The plugin does not include advertising telemetry.
