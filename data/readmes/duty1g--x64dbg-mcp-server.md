x64dbg-MCP Server is a native [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (Model Context Protocol) plugin for [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/) that exposes the debugger's full functionality over HTTP. Connect any MCP-compatible AI assistant and control x64dbg programmatically: set breakpoints, step through code, read memory, dump registers, and more.

Built with [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) — zero dependencies, single-binary output, cross-compiles to both x32 and x64 from any host. No .NET, no Python, no runtime — just drop the plugin into your x64dbg plugins folder and go.

> **MCP 2024-11-05** — Streamable HTTP + SSE transports, JSON-RPC 2.0.


## Features

- **84 MCP Tools:** Full debugger control — disassembly, stepping, breakpoints, memory allocation, registers, modules, threads, call stack, pattern scanning, string extraction, xrefs, symbols, bookmarks, PE analysis, OEP detection, module dumping, PEB/SEH inspection, tracing, and more.
- **22 Event Callbacks:** Full debugger event coverage — init, stop, breakpoint, exception, step, attach/detach, DLL load/unload, threads, and more.
- **Zero Dependencies:** Pure native plugin, no runtime or framework needed.
- **x32 and x64:** Single codebase, builds both architectures from one command.
- **Dual Transport:** Streamable HTTP + SSE — compatible with any MCP client (new and legacy).
- **Bearer Auth:** Mandatory token authentication — auto-generated on first run, required on every request to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Config Dialog:** Change IP/port/token from the Plugins menu, auto-restarts the server on save.
- **Auto-Start:** MCP server starts automatically when x64dbg launches.
- **Cross-Compile:** Build Windows plugins from Linux, macOS, or WSL.


## Install

Download the latest release or build from source:

1. Copy the contents of `dist/` into your x64dbg root folder (deploys both x32 and x64)
2. Launch x64dbg

The MCP server starts automatically. Default ports:
- **x64:** `0.0.0.0:9094`
- **x32:** `0.0.0.0:9095`


## Usage

Add to your MCP client config (`.mcp.json`, etc.):

**Streamable HTTP (recommended):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "x64dbg": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:9094/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**SSE (legacy clients):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "x64dbg": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "http://localhost:9094/sse",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If connecting from WSL or a remote machine, use the host's IP address and set the bind address to `0.0.0.0` in the config dialog.

**Example — AI-assisted reverse engineering session:**
```
You:    Load calc.exe and break at the entry point
AI: [calls LoadBinary, SetBreakpoint, run, WaitForPause]
        Loaded calc.exe, hit breakpoint at 0x7FF7A1234000 in calc.exe

You:    What are the current registers?
AI: [calls GetAllRegisters]
        RAX: 0x0, RCX: 0x7FF7A1234000, RDX: 0x1, ...

You:    Read 64 bytes at the current instruction pointer
AI: [calls ReadMemory]
        48 83 EC 28 E8 12 34 00 00 ...

You:    Step over the next 3 instructions and show me the stack
AI: [calls StepOver x3, GetCallStack]
        Stepped to 0x7FF7A1234010, call stack: ...
```

## Configuration

Go to **Plugins > x64dbg-MCP Server > Configure MCP Server...** to change the bind address, port, and auth token.

- `0.0.0.0` — listen on all interfaces (for WSL/remote access)
- `127.0.0.1` — local-only access

### Authentication

A Bearer token is auto-generated on first run and required on every request. The MCP server has full debugger control and can read/write process memory — all requests without a valid token receive `401 Unauthorized`. Click **Generate** in the config dialog to rotate the token, or **Copy** to copy it to clipboard. Clients must include the token as an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

Changes take effect immediately — the server auto-restarts on save. Config is persisted to `mcp_config.json` next to the x64dbg executable.


## Building

Requires [Zig 0.16-dev](https://ziglang.org/download/) or later. Builds on Windows, WSL, Linux, or macOS.

```console
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe --prefix dist
```

Output mirrors x64dbg's folder structure — copy the contents of `dist/` into your x64dbg root to deploy both architectures at once:
```
dist/
├── x32/
│   └── plugins/
│       └── x64dbg-MCP-Server.dp32
└── x64/
    └── plugins/
        └── x64dbg-MCP-Server.dp64
```

```


## How It Works

The plugin loads into x64dbg at startup, resolves the debugger's API symbols at runtime from `x64bridge.dll` and `x64dbg.dll`, then spins up an HTTP server on a background thread. MCP clients connect over HTTP and send JSON-RPC requests to invoke tools — each tool maps directly to x64dbg SDK calls (breakpoints, memory reads, command execution, etc.).

No polling, no external processes — the plugin lives inside x64dbg's address space with direct access to the debugger API.
