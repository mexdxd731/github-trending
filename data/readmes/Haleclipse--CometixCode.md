## What this is

Claude Code's terminal UI is TypeScript on React + Ink. CometixCode reproduces
it in Rust on iocraft, a React-style retained-mode TUI framework that is the
structural counterpart of Ink — components, hooks, declarative elements. The
port follows the original file by file rather than reinventing the
architecture: a TypeScript component maps to a Rust component, a hook to a
hook, and deliberate deviations are recorded in the source where they happen.

It builds against [CometixTUI], a fork of iocraft carrying the primitives this
port needs (row-level diffing, event propagation, SIGCONT self-healing, IME
cursor, bracketed paste, grid layout).

It is a work in progress. Large parts of the interactive loop, tool execution,
permissions, MCP and slash commands are implemented; other areas are partial.

## Building

### Prerequisites

**Rust 1.88+** (edition 2024). Nothing else — no system libraries, no
`pkg-config`. Unicode segmentation and collation come from ICU4X, whose data
is compiled into the binary.

### Build and run

```sh
cargo build --release
cargo run --release
```

The binary is `cometix`.

### Cross-compiling for Windows

```sh
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

A mingw-w64 toolchain has to be on `PATH`: four dependencies compile C or
assembly (`onig_sys`, `ring`, `tree-sitter`, `tree-sitter-bash`). They link
statically, so the resulting `.exe` needs no DLLs alongside it.

## ripgrep

File search shells out to `rg`. Claude Code ships a packaged ripgrep inside its
npm package and executes that path; CometixCode keeps the same shape — the
binary is an external asset, never compiled into the executable.

Resolution order:

1. `vendor/ripgrep/<arch>-<os>/rg` next to the executable (release archives)
2. `vendor/ripgrep/<arch>-<os>/rg` in the source tree (development)
3. the host's `rg` on `PATH`

So either drop a pinned ripgrep under `vendor/ripgrep/`, or just have `rg`
installed. `/doctor` reports which one is in use. Setting
`USE_BUILTIN_RIPGREP=0` forces the host binary.

## Testing

```sh
just test          # full suite through cargo-nextest — the gate
just t <pattern>   # substring filter
just check         # type/borrow check only, links nothing
```

`cargo test` is **not** a valid gate for this crate. It runs the whole suite as
threads in one process, and this codebase has process-wide state (env vars,
`OnceLock` caches) that leaks between tests as a result. `just test` runs under
`cargo-nextest`, which gives each test its own process, and pins the host state
a test would otherwise inherit. The justfile header explains the measurements
behind that.
