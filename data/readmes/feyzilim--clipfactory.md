> Give it a **topic** and a **template**; get a short-form vertical video (9:16, 1080×1920 — TikTok / Reels / Shorts) made from **your own B-roll**, an **AI script**, an **AI voice** and synced captions. Plus an isolated **AI Lab** that turns a sentence into a fully AI-generated vertical video.

ClipFactory is a self-hosted content pipeline you run on your own machine (Docker). It **does not post anything anywhere** — you review every video and publish it yourself. It is **not affiliated with TikTok, Meta or Google.**

## What it does

**Content factory** (PRD-driven core): `Topic + Template → Script (LLM) → Voice (ElevenLabs, real duration = master clock) → Scene plan → B-roll selection from your library → Video JSON (validated) → Captions → FFmpeg render → QC`. Every artifact is versioned; you can regenerate the script, swap B-roll, re-render with new visual variation, override a single scene, and approve.

**AI Lab** (separate module, own tables/storage/routes): `Prompt → storyboard (LLM) → keyframe images (OpenAI, each chained to the previous frame) → per-segment animation by the video model you choose (Gemini Omni, Veo 3.1, or via fal.ai: Seedance 2.0/2.5, MiniMax H3, Kling 3.0) → concatenated 9:16 MP4`, with per-segment redo/edit, length change, clones for A/B comparison and a price estimate before you start.

## Requirements

- Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine + Compose v2)
- **Your own B-roll clips** (vertical, any codec ffmpeg reads) placed under `assets/<persona>/<category>/…` — ClipFactory ships no footage; the content factory needs at least a handful of approved clips to select from (see “B-roll library” below).
- API keys for the providers you want to use (see table). Nothing works without an LLM key + a voice key for the content factory; the AI Lab additionally needs an image provider and a video provider.

| Feature | Provider | Env var(s) |
|---|---|---|
| Script / scene planning / B-roll ranking / asset enrichment | OpenAI (structured outputs) | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL` |
| Voice-over + word timestamps | ElevenLabs | `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` |
| AI Lab keyframe images | OpenAI Images (`gpt-image-2`) | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_IMAGE_MODEL`, `OPENAI_IMAGE_QUALITY` |
| AI Lab video (Gemini Omni / Veo) | Google Gemini API | `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_VIDEO_MODEL`, `GOOGLE_VEO_MODEL` |
| AI Lab video (Seedance, MiniMax H3, Kling, …) | fal.ai | `FAL_KEY`, `LAB_FAL_MODEL` |
| Offline dry run (tests/demo without any key) | built-in fakes | `LLM_PROVIDER=fake`, `VOICE_PROVIDER=fake`, `LAB_*_PROVIDER=fake` |

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/feyzilim/clipfactory.git && cd clipfactory
docker compose up -d           # builds db + api + web on first run → open http://localhost:3000
```

No `.env` needed: the first page you see is **Setup** — paste your OpenAI and ElevenLabs keys (Test connection, pick a voice), optionally Google / fal.ai for the AI Lab, save. Keys are stored in the app's local database and can be changed any time under **Settings**. (`.env` still works for headless/CI setups — copy `.env.example`; values saved in the UI override it. Tick *Offline dry run* to try the pipeline with fake providers and no keys.)

Then, in the web UI (first run, ~15 minutes + filming):

1. **Personas → New persona** — three questions (name · place & age · a paragraph about them); AI drafts the full profile, you review and create. Two example personas ship as seeds.
2. **B-roll** — the persona gets an AI **shot list** (what to film, grouped by folder, default 100 clips). Film a handful, upload them with **Add video** (AI autocomplete fills the metadata) or drop files into `assets/<persona>/<category>/` and run `make import`. The page shows how much of the target is covered.
3. **Generate** — pick template, topic, length → script, voice, scene plan, B-roll selection, captions and render run in the background; the project page shows every stage, the timeline, and lets you regenerate the script, change clips per scene, render again, approve.
4. **Batch** (Projects page) — queue N videos with AI-picked topics and follow the progress; **System → Captions** sets fonts and positions for all renders; the **AI Lab** is a separate module for fully generated clips.

CLI: `make doctor` checks keys/ffmpeg; `make generate TEMPLATE=story_v1 TOPIC="Why I stopped answering Slack in the morning"` → `storage/projects/proj_xxx/final.mp4`.

> The API has **no authentication** — run it on your machine or LAN only (see SECURITY.md).

## B-roll library

- Put clips in `assets/<persona>/<category>/name.mp4` — every clip belongs to one persona, and only that persona's projects can use it (or upload them one by one in the UI with **Add video**, choosing the persona — AI autocomplete fills description/tags/action/location/shot/mood from sampled frames).
- `make import` reads technical metadata with ffprobe; semantic metadata comes from an optional `assets/broll_database.json` seed (id/file/description/tags/shot), otherwise heuristics + **Enrich with AI**. Nothing under `assets/` is ever committed (see `assets/README.md`).
- Clips must be **approved** to be selectable (seeded clips are approved; uploaded clips default to whatever you choose).
- The scene planner is library-aware: it only plans visuals your footage can cover; the ranker receives the whole catalog when it is small (≤60 clips).
- Selection score = relevance × quality × freshness (recently used clips are de-prioritised); the start offset is random inside each clip’s usable range so repeats don’t look identical.

## CLI (`docker compose run --rm api clipfactory …`, alias `ttcf`)

| command | what |
|---|---|
| `generate --template story_v1 --topic "…" [--duration 18] [--plan-only]` | full pipeline |
| `templates` · `doctor` | list templates · environment check |
| `assets import [--approve-unseeded]` · `assets enrich [--overwrite]` · `assets list` · `assets search typing desk close` · `assets set asset_001 --quality 0.9 --tags a,b` | asset library |
| `projects create/list/show/generate` · `projects regenerate-script|change-assets|render|approve|retry ID` · `projects suggest ID SCENE` · `projects set-asset ID SCENE ASSET_ID` | project controls |
| `batch configs/batch_30.json` | batch generation with a review template per video |

## Configuration (no code changes needed)

- **Personas live in the database** and are created with a short wizard (name → place & age → free-text description → AI drafts the rest → you review) and edited in the UI (**Personas** page: identity name/age/location/background, audience, content pillars, tone, things to avoid, tools, product-mention policy, closing style, voice settings, measured speech rate). `configs/personas/*.json` are only seeds — they are inserted on first start if the table is empty, and the shipped ones are examples. Projects and B-roll are scoped per persona: the sidebar switcher selects the active persona; Generate lets you pick one per video. `DEFAULT_PERSONA` is the fallback for the CLI and legacy imports. `clipfactory assets migrate-personas --to <id>` moves a pre-persona `assets/<category>/` library under `assets/<id>/`.
- **B-roll shot list** — B-roll → *Generate shot list*: AI plans the clips to film for the active persona (target count, optional guidance); the page shows how much of it the library covers (%), which shots are still missing, and matches uploaded clips to shots (AI or manual). Regenerate any time with a new target.
- **AI B-roll** — for shots you can't film: AI B-roll page (or *Create with AI* on any shot-list item) generates a short clip with fal.ai / Omni / Veo from a start frame made by OpenAI images; upload the persona's photo once and tick *Keep this face* to get clips with the persona's own face. The clip lands in the library, approved and assigned to the shot.
- **Batch generation** — Projects → *Batch*: enter how many videos (1–60), pick templates and length; topics come from AI (persona pillars, no repeats) or a pasted list. Videos are generated one after another in the background; the Projects page shows progress per batch with stop/resume.
- **Caption font & position** — System → *Captions* sets the font (any `.ttf`/`.otf` in `fonts/`, uploadable from the UI, plus system fonts), size, weight and vertical position of captions and of the big text overlays for every render; a project's **Captions** button overrides them for that project only (applied on the next render). Five OFL fonts are bundled in `fonts/` (Anton, Bebas Neue, Montserrat, Oswald, Poppins).
- `configs/templates/*.json` — video structures (sections + weights, duration, shot length, overlays, closing rule, caption style, music category). Editable in the UI (Templates).
- `configs/captions/*.json` — caption style (font, size, colours, safe zones, chunking, animation).
- `storage/music/<category>_NN.mp3` — optional royalty-free music; mixed at −20 dB with ducking under the voice.

## Privacy, costs and content

- **Your data**: everything runs locally. The only outbound traffic is to the AI providers you configure (prompts, scripts, clip descriptions, sampled frames of uploaded B-roll for AI autocomplete, keyframe images for video generation). Nothing is sent to the ClipFactory authors; there is no telemetry.
- **Costs**: every generation calls paid APIs. Rough per-video costs: content factory ≈ $0.05–0.20 (LLM + voice); AI Lab ≈ $1–15 depending on the video model and length — the New-video dialog shows an estimate (list prices; retries/re-dos are extra). Watch your provider dashboards.
- **Generated content**: the license puts no restrictions on your output, but provider terms do (OpenAI, Google, ElevenLabs, fal.ai, ByteDance/MiniMax/Kuaishou via fal). Some models watermark output (e.g. Google SynthID). You are responsible for what you publish — ClipFactory never posts automatically and has no TikTok/Instagram/YouTube integration.

## Development

```bash
cd backend && python3.11 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]" && .venv/bin/pytest   # renderer tests need ffmpeg with libass → `make test` runs them in Docker
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev    # Vite on :3000 proxying /api → http://localhost:8000
```
Tests use fake providers and synthetic clips (no keys). See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## AI Lab example

One prompt → storyboard → 3 keyframes (gpt-image-2, each using the previous frame as reference) → 2 × 10 s clips animated with **Seedance 2.0** via fal.ai → 20 s, 1080×1920.

Prompt (translated): *"Pitching a camping tent by a forest lake, fixed camera the whole time. Start on the empty spot with the lake view, then the tent goes up — the person's face never clearly visible, time-lapse feel. At the end the person steps into the tent; clear sky that slowly darkens, and rain starts after they are inside."* Style: cinematic realistic.

![AI Lab example — keyframes (top) and frames from the finished 20 s clip (bottom)](docs/media/ai-lab-example.jpg)

Top row: the three generated keyframes. Bottom row: frames every 4 s from the final video. ▶ [Watch the MP4](https://github.com/feyzilim/clipfactory/releases/download/v0.2.0/ai-lab-example.mp4) (720×1280, 2.5 MB). Cost for this clip ≈ $6 (20 s × $0.30 + 3 low-quality images).
