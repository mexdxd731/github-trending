LinkSift is a local-first media downloader powered by [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and ffmpeg. Paste one or more supported URLs, inspect the available metadata, choose MP4 or MP3, and follow each download from the same queue.

> Built for personal, authorized use. Respect copyright law, platform terms, and creators' rights. LinkSift does not support DRM circumvention or bypassing access controls.

## What is included

- **Local-first by design** - Compose binds to `127.0.0.1:8899` by default.
- **Batch-friendly queue** - paste one or more supported URLs and process them in sequence.
- **MP4 and MP3 output** - choose a preferred format before inspection.
- **Quality selection** - choose from the available video heights returned by yt-dlp.
- **Live progress** - phase, percentage, downloaded bytes, speed, ETA, and final status.
- **Browser save controls** - use the default browser download flow or choose a folder in Chromium-based browsers.
- **Predictable runtime** - Docker includes Python, yt-dlp, ffmpeg, Gunicorn, and a non-root `linksift` user.
- **Offline CI** - regression tests mock external tools and never call media platforms.

## Quick start

Docker is the supported end-user path. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), then run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open <http://localhost:8899>. You do not need Python, yt-dlp, ffmpeg, or a virtual environment on the host.

Downloads persist in the named `linksift-downloads` Docker volume. To stop the service, press `Ctrl+C`; to run it in the background, use `docker compose up --build -d`.

## Development

The local launcher is for contributors and requires Python 3.12, yt-dlp, and ffmpeg:

```bash
./linksift.sh
```

Before opening a pull request, run:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python -m py_compile app.py
docker compose config
docker build -t linksift:local .
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the contributor workflow and pull request checklist.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `PORT` | `8899` | HTTP port used by the development server. |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address. Keep it local unless a protected reverse proxy is in front. |
| `LINKSIFT_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT` | `3600` | Maximum seconds allowed for one yt-dlp process. |
| `LINKSIFT_MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS` | `3` | Maximum simultaneous downloads in the in-memory worker. |
| `LINKSIFT_NO_UPDATE` | unset | Set to `1` to skip the startup yt-dlp update. |

Job state is held in memory. The Docker command therefore uses one Gunicorn worker; restarting the service clears active job status. Do not add workers until job state moves to shared storage.

## Supported sites

LinkSift accepts the sites supported by [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md), including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Reddit, Facebook, Vimeo, Twitch, SoundCloud, Loom, Streamable, Pinterest, Tumblr, Threads, LinkedIn, and many more.

The supported-site list changes with yt-dlp releases. LinkSift updates yt-dlp at container startup by default; set `LINKSIFT_NO_UPDATE=1` to opt out.

## Security and network exposure

LinkSift accepts URLs for yt-dlp to process and has no built-in authentication. **Do not expose it directly to the internet or an untrusted LAN.** If remote access is required, place it behind a reverse proxy with TLS, authentication, rate limiting, and egress controls that you operate.
