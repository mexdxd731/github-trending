## Overview

RealReplicaBench evaluates whether an agent can complete long-horizon business
workflows, not just answer questions about them. Tasks cover browser operations,
native-style CLI tools, API/MCP workflows, document and spreadsheet production,
public-web research, supplier analysis, product publishing, logistics, and
commerce operations. Every task runs in a fresh container and is graded by its
own deterministic or LLM-assisted verifier.

- **107 tasks:** 53 CLI, 28 browser, 16 file, and 10 API/MCP tasks.
- **Three capability slices:** 65 text-only, 20 browser-text-capable, and 22
  vision-required tasks.
- **Stateful evaluation:** local mock services model SaaS, commerce, messaging,
  document, and operational systems without requiring production accounts.
- **Auditable outputs:** each run preserves the resolved configuration,
  trajectory, verifier result, artifacts, logs, and container metadata.

### Real task surfaces

The suite uses reproducible local replicas of commerce and business software,
so agents must operate interfaces and change state.

## Reference results

Results are aligned by `task_id` over the complete 107-task collection. The
tables below are per harness — twelve model families on OpenClaw, thirteen on
Accio — and the twelve present in both are the ones that compare directly.
The published scores were produced through Accio-managed evaluation endpoints
with `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` as the judge; the public path in this repository
uses bring-your-own credentials.

The [live leaderboard](https://realreplicabench.site.accio.ai/) is the
source of record; the tables below are a snapshot.

### Detailed evaluation statistics

Pass and capacity use the same verifier semantics across harnesses. Steps,
time, and tokens are descriptive telemetry: tool granularity, runtime
scheduling, and provider usage accounting differ, so these values are not
normalized efficiency scores.

🥇🥈🥉 mark the top three within each harness. The bar in the Pass column is
drawn on a fixed 0–100% scale, not normalized to the leader, so bar lengths
are directly comparable between the two tables.

public immutable URLs or checksums. Until they do, the published board is an
audited aggregate keyed by public result IDs, not a standalone reproduction
package.

### Metrics

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| Pass | A task passes only when every required verifier check passes; the rate is passes over the 107 aligned tasks. |
| Avg. capacity | Macro mean of each task's `checks_passed / checks_total`; this preserves partial task completion but is not a weighted official score. |
| Avg. steps | Mean trajectory tool-call count over the displayed task attempts. |
| Avg. time | Mean task wall-clock duration, using summary duration or audited manifest timestamps when the summary duration is zero. |
| Avg. tokens | Mean total model tokens per task after normalizing provider-specific usage fields; cached tokens are included when reported. |

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Docker with Linux container support (`linux/amd64`; Apple Silicon hosts can
  use emulation).
- Python 3.11 or newer.
- A model API key and an LLM-judge API key.

### Install

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .
real-replica-bench list
```

### Pull the pinned OpenClaw runtime

The human-readable tag is mutable, so evaluation commands pin the current
release digest:

```bash
docker pull --platform linux/amd64 \
  acciolyk/accio_bench@sha256:1e9cf5c72a56794175b7d06ece036b92e296e6b7e9e9a7fa244026f6acea3859
```

The image contains OpenClaw `2026.5.22`, the browser stack, and the isolated
domain mock suite.

### Run one task

This example uses Gemini's native `generateContent` path and the public Google
API:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="..."

real-replica-bench run api-amazon-margin-floor-audit \
  --harness openclaw \
  --image acciolyk/accio_bench@sha256:1e9cf5c72a56794175b7d06ece036b92e296e6b7e9e9a7fa244026f6acea3859 \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  --openclaw-model google/gemini-3.5-flash \
  --openclaw-image-model google/gemini-3.5-flash \
  --openclaw-models-config configs/realreplicabench_native_google_direct_models.json \
  --llm-judge-provider gemini \
  --llm-judge-model gemini-3.1-pro-preview \
  --run-id realreplicabench-smoke
```

### Run a collection

```bash
real-replica-bench run \
  --config configs/realreplicabench_openclaw_native_google_direct.yaml \
  --run-id "realreplicabench-openclaw-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
```

Use `--limit 1` for a batch-path smoke test. The full suite can be partitioned
with the `*_text_only`, `*_browser_textcapable`, and `*_vision` collection
files under `datasets_domain_v1/`.

### Provider routes

Every route is one config file in `configs/`, all named
`realreplicabench_openclaw<suffix>.yaml`. The tables list the suffix.

**Managed routes** — a provider's own API, billed to that provider's key.

| Route | Suffix | Wire protocol | Credentials |
|---|---|---|---|
| Native Gemini | `_native_google_direct` | Gemini `generateContent` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| Native Qwen / DashScope | `_qwen37plus_native` | DashScope OpenAI-compatible | `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` |
| OpenRouter | *(none)* | OpenRouter chat, bundled shim | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| Qwen through OpenRouter | `_qwen37plus_openrouter` | OpenRouter chat, bundled shim | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| Custom native Gemini | `_native_google` | Gemini `generateContent` | Provider-specific |

**Bring your own endpoint** — point OpenClaw at any base URL you control that
speaks one of these four wire formats, and evaluate a self-hosted or
pre-release model.

| Wire format | Suffix | Credentials |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` | `_openai_chat` | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or your endpoint's var |
| OpenAI `/v1/responses` | `_openai_responses` | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or your endpoint's var |
| Anthropic `/v1/messages` | `_anthropic_messages` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or your endpoint's var |
| Gemini `generateContent` | `_custom_gemini` | `CUSTOM_GEMINI_BASE_URL` + `CUSTOM_GEMINI_API_KEY` |

Override the endpoint with `baseUrl` in the models JSON,
`--openclaw-provider-base-url` (`--openclaw-base-url` for OpenRouter), or
`--openclaw-api` to skip the preset entirely — see
[`docs/openclaw-byo-endpoint.md`](docs/openclaw-byo-endpoint.md).

The judge is configured independently of the agent, on Gemini `generateContent`
or the OpenAI Responses API. Six tasks include LLM-assisted checks; keep the
judge on `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` unless you report a different one.

Supply credentials through environment variables: the batch runner redacts them
from `run.yaml` and fails on unresolved `${...}` placeholders before a container
starts. Evaluated models run with shell access to their container — see
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the key-handling rules that implies.

### API validation boundary

Every route above — the Gemini, Qwen, and OpenRouter agents and both Judges,
including reasoning through the bundled shim and custom upstream base URLs —
has been exercised against local protocol recorders, without real credentials
or billable calls, under the exact request/response contracts covered by
`tests/test_public_api.py`.

This proves request construction and response parsing, not provider-side model
entitlement, quota, or billing. Before a full run, use `--limit 1` with your own
keys and record the provider/model snapshot in the run metadata.

Deeper reference:
[`docs/openclaw-runtime-image.md`](docs/openclaw-runtime-image.md) for the
runtime image's identity, pin, and customization boundary;
[`docs/openclaw-native-gemini.md`](docs/openclaw-native-gemini.md) and
[`docs/openclaw-native-qwen.md`](docs/openclaw-native-qwen.md) for the native
provider routes.

## Reproducibility contract

Comparable runs pin these four:

| Component | v1.3.1 pin |
|---|---|
| Task set | `realreplicabench_domain_v1_all` — 107 task IDs |
| Task definitions | This repository release, including task workspaces and graders |
| Harness | OpenClaw runner in this repository |
| Runtime | `acciolyk/accio_bench@sha256:1e9cf5c72a56794175b7d06ece036b92e296e6b7e9e9a7fa244026f6acea3859` |

Report the rest: provider, exact model and judge identifiers, endpoint class,
reasoning configuration, task count, retry policy, and aggregation rule.
Compare results only within one benchmark version — a release can change what a
task accepts — and never by displayed model name alone: routing, model
snapshots, prompt adapters, retry policies, and judge endpoints all change
outcomes.

## Task and run layout

```text
datasets_domain_v1/
├── realreplicabench_domain_v1_{all,text_only,browser_textcapable,vision}.collection.json
└── <interface>/<platform>/<task>/
    ├── task.toml   task.md   workspace/          agent-visible
    └── grader/     services/ private/ rubric.json
```

Only `task.md` and `workspace/` are staged into the agent-visible task tree;
graders, rubrics, private seeds, service launchers, and mock source stay
outside it, and final artifacts go to `/task/outputs/`. After the agent exits,
the host-side verifier reads those outputs and the isolated mock state, writes
the reward record, archives logs and trajectories, removes the container, and
leaves:

```text
runs/<run_id>/
├── run.yaml   summary.json   summary.md   report.html
└── tasks/<index>-<task_id>/
    └── manifest.json  agent/  verifier/  workspace/outputs/  screenshots/  container/
```

## Contributing

**We are asking for your mock environments.** A benchmark with a fixed task set
decays: models saturate it and its answers drift into training data. Each new
replica service — a real service's API semantics, state transitions, and above
all its rejections, running offline and scored deterministically — is a family
of tasks no model has been trained on. The fourteen shipping today are
registered in `real_replica_bench/mock_services/registry.py`.

[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) states the bar a new mock has to clear, and
the rules for task fixes, graders, and harness changes. A merged mock reaches
the published benchmark when maintainers next rebake the runtime image.

The Accio team at Alibaba International built the harness, the mock services,
and the v1 task suite; your pull request adds you to
[`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](CONTRIBUTORS.md) alongside the mock itself.
