## Why hexis

An agent skill (a `SKILL.md` document) tells an agent how to carry out a class of tasks. In the usual way of
executing a skill, the document sits in the model's context and the model chooses every next step, so
requirements that the document states clearly can still be skipped, reordered or applied in the wrong situation.

hexis compiles the skill into an **extended finite state machine**. The machine records progress in a current
state and a set of variables, executes the operation assigned to the current state and evaluates transition
guards over the recorded values to decide what comes next. Language models do the reasoning and generation inside
states, with the state's prompt and the variables it reads; the order of operations is enforced by the program.

This package accompanies the paper *Compiling Agent Skills into Extended Finite State Machines*.

</p>
## Highlights

- **Compile with any OpenAI-compatible model.** Choose the model, endpoint and key variable on the command line
  (`--model`, `--base-url`, `--api-key-env`); the model drafts the machine and redrafts it under check feedback.
- **Update with new traces, one decision per step.** A model decides for every step of a new trace whether an
  existing state produces it, a new state is needed, or the step is noise. Static checks and replay of *every*
  previously accepted trace guard each change, so a wrong decision cannot break the machine. Answers are cached
  and runs resume where they stopped.
- **Usage guides.** Every build gets `GUIDE.md` (inputs, tools, a diagram, every state and transition) and
  `PROMPT.md`, a system prompt that lets any tool-using agent execute the machine step by step.
- **Readable, executable machines.** Plain JSON (`efsm-v1`) with typed variables, `tool` / `model` / `judge` /
  `user` / `end` actions, ordered guarded transitions, bounded loops and a fallback state.
- **Graceful degradation.** The fallback state retries from the most recent tool step and then hands the task to
  interpreted execution of the skill, so a partially learned machine can still finish a task.
- **Real tool backends.** OpenCode's native tools, a local `bash` backend, or tools that the model realizes from
  registry definitions.
- **Example machines.** Four compiled machines (data analysis, mathematics, question answering over a corpus,
  spreadsheet editing) ship in `examples/machines/`, each with its guide.
- **Hermetic test suite.** More than 350 tests that need no network access, model endpoint or API key.

## How it works

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/figures/system.png" width="880"
       alt="(a) Initialization: a model drafts machine.json from the skill document and tool specs and redrafts it until validation passes. (b) Trajectory update: events are extracted from a trace, aligned with the machine, applied to a copy, and the copy is accepted only after checks and replay">
</p>

*(a) Initialization: a language model drafts `machine.json` from the skill document and the tool specifications
and redrafts it until validation passes, giving the initial machine M0. (b) Trajectory update: each trace is
folded into events, aligned with the current machine and applied to a copy (match, new, ignore); the copy is
accepted only if it passes the invariants and replays both the new trace and every previously accepted trace.
Otherwise the update is retried once and the machine is kept.*

1. **Compile.** The model reads the skill document, its clauses, the tool definitions, the task input fields and
   the skill rules, and drafts a machine. Static checks (format, schema, guards, reachability and termination,
   clause coverage, tools) return errors to the model until a draft passes.
2. **Update.** Each trace is normalized into events. For every step the decider (a model, a decisions file, or
   deterministic alignment) chooses how the machine accounts for it, a candidate machine is built by reusing or
   adding states and transitions, and the candidate is accepted only if it passes the variable, evidence,
   requirement and structure checks and replays the new trace and every previously accepted trace.
3. **Execution.** The runtime executes the action of the current state, writes the declared variables and takes
   the first transition whose guard holds. Models are called only for `model` and `judge` states.

## Installation

```bash
pip install hexis-agent             # the package is imported as `hexis`; the command is `hexis-agent`
pip install .                       # from a checkout; Python >= 3.11
pip install -e ".[dev]"             # with pytest, build, twine and ruff for development
```

Running machines on real tasks also requires:

| Requirement | Used for |
|---|---|
| An OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint | model calls (see [Configuration](#configuration)) |
| [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) on `PATH` | native tool execution (`--executor local` runs `bash` without it) |

## Quick start

The package ships a small hermetic example skill, `table_clean`, with scripted tools and a scripted model, so a
machine runs without network access:

```python
from hexis.execution import runtime
from hexis.examples import table_clean as tc

machine = tc.reference_machine()
task = tc.gen_tasks(1, seed=0)[0]
result = runtime.run_task(
    machine, task,
    model=tc.build_model(),
    tools=tc.build_registry(tc.MemFS(task["files"])),
    doc=tc.skill_doc(),
)
print(result.stopped, " -> ".join(result.path()), tc.verify(task, result.trace))
# terminal s1 -> s2 -> s4 -> end True
```

With a real skill and a model endpoint:

```bash
export API_KEY=...                         # or put MODEL / BASE_URL / API_KEY in a .env file
M="--model qwen3.6-flash --base-url https://your-endpoint/v1"

# 1. compile a machine from the skill document
hexis-agent compile --skill path/to/skill --out build/ $M

# 2. fold execution traces of the skill into the machine
hexis-agent update --build build/ --traces traces/ --show 3    # preview: no model calls, nothing written
hexis-agent update --build build/ --traces traces/ $M

# 3. use the machine
cat build/GUIDE.md                          # how the machine works; build/PROMPT.md is the agent prompt
hexis-agent run --machine build/ --input request="..." --workdir work/ --executor local $M
```

## Example machines

`examples/machines/` holds four machines compiled from skills for four task families, each with the `GUIDE.md`
that `hexis-agent guide` writes for it (inputs, tools, a Mermaid diagram, every state and transition):

| Machine | Task | Inputs | States |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`dabench`](examples/machines/dabench/) | answer a data-analysis question about one data file with a computation | `request`, `data_path`, `work_dir`, `output_path` | 15 |
| [`livemath`](examples/machines/livemath/) | answer a theorem-grounded multiple-choice mathematics question | `request`, `output_path` | 12 |
| [`sealqa`](examples/machines/sealqa/) | answer a question from a local corpus of page files, with evidence | `request`, `docs_dir`, `work_dir`, `output_path` | 21 |
| [`spreadsheet`](examples/machines/spreadsheet/) | edit a workbook without changing its structure | `request`, `input_path`, `output_path` | 17 |

All four follow the same pattern: a `model` state writes a shell command, a `tool` state runs it, transitions
branch on `returncode` with bounded retry counters, the answer file is read back and a `judge` state decides
whether the run ends in `END_VERIFIED` or `END_UNVERIFIED`. They load and pass the structural checks without a
model; running them needs a model endpoint:

```bash
hexis-agent run --machine examples/machines/livemath --input request="..." --input output_path=answer.txt \
    --workdir work/ --executor local $M
```

See [examples/machines/README.md](examples/machines/README.md) for the flow of each machine.

## Concepts

### Machines

A machine is a JSON document in the `efsm-v1` format (`hexis.machine.schema.Machine`):

```json
{
  "format": "efsm-v1",
  "skill_id": "answer-file",
  "initial": "draft",
  "fallback": "FALLBACK",
  "variables": [
    {"name": "request", "init_from": "task.input.request"},
    {"name": "output_path", "init_from": "task.input.output_path"},
    {"name": "write_count", "type": "integer", "init": 0}
  ],
  "states": {
    "draft": {"id": "draft",
              "action": {"kind": "model", "reads": ["request", "output_path"], "writes": ["command"],
                         "prompt": "Solve the request. Write command: one shell command that writes only the final answer to output_path."},
              "transitions": [{"if": "write_count >= 2", "to": "FALLBACK"}, {"if": "", "to": "write"}]},
    "write": {"id": "write",
              "action": {"kind": "tool", "name": "bash", "input": {"command": "${command}"},
                         "writes": ["returncode", "stdout", "stderr"], "phase": "apply"},
              "transitions": [{"if": "returncode == 0", "to": "check"},
                              {"if": "", "to": "draft", "inc": "write_count"}]},
    "check": {"id": "check",
              "action": {"kind": "tool", "name": "read", "input": {"filePath": "${output_path}"},
                         "writes": ["ok", "stdout"], "phase": "verify"},
              "transitions": [{"if": "ok", "to": "END_VERIFIED"}, {"if": "", "to": "END_UNVERIFIED"}]},
    "END_VERIFIED": {"id": "END_VERIFIED", "action": {"kind": "end", "terminal": "END_VERIFIED"}},
    "END_UNVERIFIED": {"id": "END_UNVERIFIED", "action": {"kind": "end", "terminal": "END_UNVERIFIED"}},
    "FALLBACK": {"id": "FALLBACK", "action": {"kind": "end", "terminal": "END_FALLBACK"}}
  },
  "terminals": [
    {"id": "END_VERIFIED", "kind": "verified"},
    {"id": "END_UNVERIFIED", "kind": "unverified"},
    {"id": "END_FALLBACK", "kind": "fallback"}
  ]
}
```

| Element | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `variables` | Initialized from task inputs (`init_from`) or constants (`init`) and written by actions |
| `tool` action | Runs a named tool; `${var}` in the argument template is substituted at run time; outputs are written to `writes` |
| `model` action | Generates the listed variables from the state's prompt and the variables it reads |
| `judge` action | Chooses one label from a fixed set, or abstains (the abstain label is `abstain`) |
| `user` / `end` action | Asks for input / finishes with a terminal |
| `transitions` | Evaluated in order after the action; the first guard that holds is taken; an empty guard is unconditional and comes last; `inc` increments a loop counter |
| `fallback` | Retries from the most recent tool step, then hands the task to interpreted execution of the skill |

Guards use a small whitelisted expression language (`hexis.machine.cond`) that supports static checks of mutual
exclusion and loop bounds; it never calls `eval`.

### Traces

Traces are JSON Lines files: a header with the task and its verdict, then one line per step.

```json
{"task_id": "t1", "arm": "agent", "harness": "opencode", "model": "qwen3.6-flash", "verdict": "accepted", "input": {"request": "...", "input_path": "", "output_path": "answer.txt"}}
{"kind": "tool", "name": "bash", "args": {"command": "python3 solve.py > answer.txt"}, "stdout": "", "stderr": "", "returncode": 0}
{"kind": "model", "text": "The answer has been written to answer.txt."}
{"kind": "end"}
```

`hexis-agent run --json FILE` writes the trace of a run in this format, and `hexis.traces.trace_adapter.load_any_trace`
also reads raw agent event logs.

### Skill rules

A `compile.json` next to `SKILL.md` declares terminals, derived labels, requirements and terminal conditions. Every
rule quotes the sentence of the skill document it comes from. Without the file, the compiler asks the model to
extract the rules and checks each quote against the document; the effective rules are saved as `rules.json` in the
build directory.

```json
{
  "terminals": [{"id": "END_VERIFIED", "kind": "verified"}, {"id": "END_UNVERIFIED", "kind": "unverified"}],
  "labels": [
    {"label": "verify",
     "when": {"kind": "tool", "label": "probe", "args_contain": "${output_path}", "after": {"label": "apply"}},
     "quote": "Read the output file back after writing it."}
  ],
  "requirements": [
    {"id": "R1", "kind": "before", "a": {"kind": "tool", "label": "probe"}, "b": {"kind": "tool", "label": "apply"},
     "quote": "Inspect the input before changing anything."}
  ],
  "terminal_conditions": [
    {"terminal": "END_VERIFIED",
     "required_evidence": [{"kind": "tool", "label": "verify", "success": true}],
     "invalidating_events": [{"kind": "tool", "label": "apply"}],
     "quote": "Read the output file back after writing it."}
  ]
}
```

### Tools

Tool definitions come from a registry (`hexis/tools/backends/opencode.json` describes OpenCode's native tools, or
pass `--tools registry.json`) or are inferred from traces. The compiler treats tool names as opaque identifiers.
At run time a machine may only use tools that the backend provides, or tools defined in a `--tools` registry,
which the model then realizes as shell commands; tools are never silently substituted.

### Build directory

`compile --out BUILD` writes everything a later `update` needs:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `machine.json` / `machine_init.json` | the current machine / the initial machine |
| `build.json` | manifest: skill, tool registry and rules sources, one record per run (command, decider, model id and base URL, outcomes, token usage); never an API key |
| `skill/SKILL.md`, `tools.json`, `rules.json` | the inputs of the compilation |
| `traces/` | copies of every trace used, named `<file stem>-<content hash>.jsonl` |
| `progress.json` | the outcome of every trace and the accepted traces that protect the machine |
| `decisions.jsonl` | every model question and answer (the cache of `update`) |
| `report.md`, `context.json`, `init_log.json`, `update_log.json` | reports and logs |
| `GUIDE.md`, `PROMPT.md` | usage guide and agent prompt |

## Updating a machine with a model

```bash
hexis-agent update --build build/ --traces new_traces/ --model MODEL --base-url URL
```

For each new trace, and for each step of it, the model sees the step (tool, arguments, results, narration), the
task inputs, the skill's clauses and the candidate states that could produce the step, and answers:

```json
{"decision": "match | new | ignore | exclude", "state": "<candidate id or null>",
 "purpose": "<one sentence>", "clause": "<clause id or empty>"}
```

- `match` reuses a state (adding a transition if needed); `new` adds a state whose argument prompt is built from
  the purpose; `ignore` removes harness noise from the trace; `exclude` leaves the whole trace out.
- A candidate machine is accepted only if it passes the checks, replays the new trace and replays **every trace
  accepted before**, including those of earlier runs. Otherwise the machine is unchanged and the trace is
  recorded as rejected.
- Answers are cached in `decisions.jsonl`: running the same command again asks nothing new, and after an
  interruption (exit status 3) it continues where it stopped. `--no-cache` asks again.
- The deterministic proposal is never shown to the model; it is used only when the model gives no valid answer
  after one repair turn.
- Cost: about one model call per trace step. `--show N` previews pending traces and the number of steps without
  calling the model; `--max-traces N` limits a run.
- Other deciders: `--decisions FILE` applies decisions written by a person or another tool (the same JSON shape
  per step, keyed by trace), and `--decider align` uses deterministic alignment without any model calls. `compile
  --traces` uses deterministic alignment by default and a model with `--decider model`.

Before processing anything, `update` checks that the current machine still passes the checks and replays every
accepted trace; if it does not (for example after a manual edit, or when tool definitions inferred from traces
changed), it stops with exit status 2 without changing anything.

## Using a machine

- **Read the guide.** `GUIDE.md` lists the task inputs, the tools, a Mermaid diagram, every state with its prompt
  or tool call, the transitions in evaluation order, loop limits and fallback behaviour.
- **Run it.** `hexis-agent run --machine BUILD --input KEY=VALUE ... --workdir DIR` runs the machine on any
  inputs with the hexis runtime (`--executor local` runs `bash` in a subprocess, the default executor uses
  OpenCode's tools); `--json FILE` saves the trace.
- **Give it to an agent.** `PROMPT.md` is a system prompt that tells a tool-using agent (for example Claude Code
  or OpenCode) how to execute the machine state by state: the execution loop, variables, the guard language, the
  tools, every state and its transitions, the finishing report and the fallback procedure. `hexis-agent guide
  --embed-skill` appends the skill document so the agent can finish a task after falling back.
- **From Python.** `hexis.execution.runtime.run_task(machine, {"input": {...}}, model=..., tools=..., doc=...)`.

`hexis-agent guide --build BUILD` (or `--machine machine.json`) regenerates both files; `compile` and `update`
write them automatically unless `--no-guide` is given.

## Command-line interface

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `hexis-agent compile` | Initialize a machine from a skill document with a model, optionally fold in traces; writes a build directory |
| `hexis-agent update` | Fold new traces into a build; a model (or a decisions file, or deterministic alignment) decides every step |
| `hexis-agent guide` | Write `GUIDE.md` and `PROMPT.md` for a machine |
| `hexis-agent run` | Execute a machine on one task with inputs given on the command line |
| `hexis-agent compile-stepwise` | Update a machine trace by trace with step decisions from a file (`--show`, `--apply`, `--report`) |

Run `hexis-agent <command> --help` for all options; `python -m hexis` is equivalent to `hexis-agent`.

### Configuration

| Setting | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--model`, `--base-url` | Model id and OpenAI-compatible base URL; override `MODEL` / `BASE_URL` |
| `--api-key-env NAME` | Environment variable that holds the API key (default `API_KEY`); keys are never passed on the command line |
| `--provider NAME` | Read `NAME_MODEL`, `NAME_BASE_URL`, `NAME_API_KEY` instead (built-in defaults for `minimax` and `deepseek`) |
| `MODEL`, `BASE_URL`, `API_KEY` | Default endpoint |
| `.env` | Read from the working directory upward; variables already set in the environment take precedence |
| `--temperature`, `--max-tokens`, `--llm-timeout`, `--llm-retries`, `--stream`, `--extra-body JSON` | Request settings for `compile` and `update` (`--extra-body` is merged into every request, e.g. `'{"enable_thinking": false}'`) |
| `--no-think`, `--think-budget`, `--judge-think-budget` | Reasoning controls of `run` for Qwen-compatible endpoints |

See `.env.example` for a template. Exit statuses: 0 success, 2 usage, configuration or build problem, 3 model
endpoint failure or interruption (progress is saved).

## Security and privacy

hexis executes tool calls whose arguments are generated by language models, including shell commands. Run it in an
isolated environment and only with machines and task files you trust. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

`update` sends trace steps (tool arguments and shortened results) and the skill's clauses to the configured model
endpoint, and a build directory keeps copies of the traces and every question sent. `PROMPT.md` contains the whole
machine, including prompts derived from the skill document; the runtime itself only ever shows a model the prompt
of the state it is executing. Review build directories and prompts before sharing them.
