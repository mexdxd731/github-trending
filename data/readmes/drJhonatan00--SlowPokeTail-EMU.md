## Troubleshooting

### The APK cannot be installed

Check whether an earlier version signed with a different key is installed on the device. If so, uninstall the previous version only after completing any necessary backup, then try again.

### Textures are still missing or magenta

This issue may be related to the game, graphics configuration, Android version, or device compatibility. Try another project version and confirm that the APK was downloaded correctly.

### The application is unstable

SlowPokeTail is an experimental project. Try lowering the resolution or graphics quality, closing other applications running in the background, and testing the APK in a clean installation.
