# intermission

A Claude Code plugin that drops you into Doom deathmatch while Claude works, and hands you back when it's done.

When Claude has been working for two seconds, a pane opens beside the
transcript and you drop into a free-for-all on a shared server with everyone
else who is waiting on Claude. When Claude finishes there's a three-second
countdown and you're handed back. If Claude needs you, say for a permission
prompt, you're handed back at once and dropped in again after you answer.

It's [Odamex](https://odamex.net) with [Freedoom](https://freedoom.github.io)'s
maps, with monsters left in so the server is never empty.

## Install

1. Install the plugin:

   ```
   /plugin install intermission --marketplace jarrodwatts/intermission
   ```

2. Turn it on:

   ```
   /intermission
   ```

   The first time, it downloads the game, about 20 MB.

To turn it off again, run `/intermission off`.

## Requirements

- macOS 15 or later, on Apple silicon or Intel
- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) or [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/),
  the terminals that can show the game's pixels
- Claude Code 2.1.287 or later

## Controls

Click the game to play. The click also locks the mouse for turning; Esc or ⌘
releases it.

| | |
| :- | :- |
| Move | WASD or the arrow keys |
| Turn | the mouse, once locked |
| Fire | left click |
| Run forward | hold right click |
| Open doors | space |
| Weapons | 1 to 7 |

If your terminal is too narrow for the pane to open by itself, a line above the
prompt offers it instead: press 1.

## What it connects to

The game connects over UDP to the intermission server at `157.245.140.115`,
under a random name such as `QueuedMarine42`. Nothing about your session,
project or Claude's work is sent. Between rounds it stays connected as a silent
spectator, and disconnects after five minutes away.

## How it works

The mod runs Odamex without a window. Each frame goes into shared memory, which
the terminal paints into the pane, and the pane passes keys and clicks back.
Terminals report key presses but not releases, so a key counts as held until
its auto-repeat stops. The changes to Odamex are in
[`engine/odamex.patch`](engine/odamex.patch), applied to the commit in
[`engine/odamex-commit`](engine/odamex-commit).

The server is stock Odamex; [`deploy.sh`](deploy.sh) builds and runs it on a
droplet.

## Licenses

The mod is MIT, as in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). Odamex is GPL-2.0, and so are the
changes to it in `engine/`. Freedoom is BSD-3-Clause.
