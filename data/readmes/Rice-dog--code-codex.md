Code-Codex is an unofficial community project that adds a local project file tree
to Codex Desktop. It demonstrates a local Windows companion app, a bounded
workspace bridge, and an injected TypeScript explorer UI for file preview,
editing, navigation, and file operations.

## Install Option 1: Download EXE

Download the ready-made installer from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Rice-dog/code-codex/releases/tag/v0.1.29):

- Recommended: [`CodeCodex-0.1.29-x64-setup.exe`](https://github.com/Rice-dog/code-codex/releases/download/v0.1.29/CodeCodex-0.1.29-x64-setup.exe)
- Alternative: [`CodeCodex-0.1.29-x64.msi`](https://github.com/Rice-dog/code-codex/releases/download/v0.1.29/CodeCodex-0.1.29-x64.msi)
- Portable package: [`CodeCodex-0.1.29-x64.zip`](https://github.com/Rice-dog/code-codex/releases/download/v0.1.29/CodeCodex-0.1.29-x64.zip)
- Standalone uninstaller: [`Uninstall-CodeCodex.exe`](https://github.com/Rice-dog/code-codex/releases/download/v0.1.29/Uninstall-CodeCodex.exe)

You can verify downloads with:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\CodeCodex-0.1.29-x64-setup.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

Compare the result with
[`SHA256SUMS.txt`](https://github.com/Rice-dog/code-codex/releases/download/v0.1.29/SHA256SUMS.txt).

If the official Codex/ChatGPT Desktop app is installed, the installer checks
for a desktop `Codex` shortcut first and a desktop `ChatGPT` shortcut second.
Only when neither shortcut exists does it create a new managed `Code-Codex`
desktop shortcut.

## Install Option 2: Build EXEs From Source

Requirements:

- Windows 11 x64.
- Rust with the MSVC toolchain.
- Node.js 20 or newer.
- Visual Studio Build Tools with Desktop C++.
- .NET SDK if you want to build the MSI package.

Build the release EXE files:

```powershell
./scripts/build.ps1 -Configuration Release
```

The generated EXE files are written to `target/release/`, including:

- `code-codex.exe`
- `code-codex-launcher.exe`
- `Install-CodeCodex.exe`
- `Uninstall-CodeCodex.exe`
- `code-codex-setup.exe`
- `code-codex-shim.exe`
- `code-codex-shortcut.exe`
- `code-codex-uninstall.exe`

Generate the downloadable setup EXE, MSI, and ZIP:

```powershell
./scripts/package.ps1 -Version 0.1.29
```

The generated packages are written to `releases/`.

## Uninstall

Every install path includes a source-built uninstaller program:

- Downloaded setup/ZIP installs place `Uninstall-CodeCodex.exe` under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Code-Codex`.
- Source builds place `Uninstall-CodeCodex.exe`,
  `Uninstall-CodeCodex.ps1`, and `Finalize-Uninstall.ps1` in `target/release/`.

Run `Uninstall-CodeCodex.exe` to restore the original Codex or ChatGPT shortcut
and remove Code-Codex files. If installation created a standalone `Code-Codex`
desktop shortcut because both official shortcuts were missing, uninstall removes
that shortcut. MSI installs can also be removed from Windows **Installed apps**.

## Features

- File tree in the Codex sidebar for local workspaces.
- Main-window file tabs beside the conversation.
- Text preview and editing, including multilingual Markdown content.
- Context menu actions for create, rename, delete, copy path, reveal, and refresh.
- Drag and drop file movement.
- Local bridge code for bounded workspace operations.
