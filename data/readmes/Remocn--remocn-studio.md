## The pitch

Describe the video you want. A coding agent builds it as a real
[Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev) project. You watch the live preview change
while it works, and export an mp4 when it looks right.

This isn't another AI video editor. There's no timeline, no keyframes and no
track management. You write prompts, point at things and give notes.

**Not a generator. Not a template.** AI video tools usually make you pick one:
generate pixels you can't edit, or drag in templates everyone recognizes.
Remocn Studio takes a third route. The agent writes the motion design as code
and takes direction as you watch.

|                     | Pixel generators    | Template editors       | **Remocn Studio**               |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| What you get        | A video file        | Someone else's layout  | **A Remotion project**          |
| Changing one word   | Generate it again   | Hunt for the layer     | **Say it, or click it**         |
| What it looks like  | Close enough        | Everyone else's video  | **Your brand**                  |
| Where it lives      | Their cloud         | Their account          | **A folder on your disk**       |

## You direct. It shoots.

Remocn Studio puts you in the director's chair. You watch the take, then give
notes:

> "Fix the text here."
> "The animation is too fast here."
> "Why did everything break here?"

There are three ways to say *here*:

- **Type it.** Plain words in the chat, taken exactly as you wrote them.
- **Point at it.** Click any element in the preview. Playback pauses and the
  properties pane opens, with type, spacing and easing curves as controls you
  can drag. Every change is saved into the source. You can double-click text
  to rewrite it in place, or drag an object to move or resize it. Add the
  element to the chat and it goes along with your message as `[Element #1]`.
- **Frame it.** Drag a **Snapshot** box over the frame and the crop goes into
  the chat as a picture, ready to talk about.

## How a video gets made

You don't get a prompt box that hopes for the best. You get a production
pipeline with seven stages. At every stage the agent writes a document into
your project, so you can read, edit or overrule each decision.

| #   | Stage        | In the app you'll see            | It leaves behind                                                    |
| --- | ------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Analysis     | *Analysing the material*         | `analysis.md`: audience, promise, format, what's missing            |
| 2   | Brand        | *Collecting the brand*           | `brand.md`, plus your original logos, copied unchanged              |
| 3   | Script       | *Writing the script*             | `script.md`: every shot, its message, its timing                    |
| 4   | Motion       | *Defining the motion language*   | `motion.md`: which component plays which shot                       |
| 5   | Build        | *Building the video*             | The scenes themselves, plus keyframes it rendered to check its work |
| 6   | Choreography | *Choreographing the whole video* | `choreography.md`: rhythm, continuity, reading time                 |
| 7   | Review       | *Reviewing the result*           | `review.md`: every note, closed with evidence                       |

The agent doesn't guess what looks good. A curated set of motion design skills
ships with the app: easing, pacing, typography animation, and a record of what
has failed on screen before. Before calling a video done, the agent runs
`design_check`, which measures the rendered frames for readability, timing and
handoffs.

Also in the kit:

- **Every platform's shape.** Export presets for YouTube, Shorts · Reels ·
  TikTok and Instagram Feed: wide, vertical and square.
- **A moodboard before a single frame.** No brand yet? The agent can build a
  moodboard from stock photos and work from its palette and type.
- **Sound and music.** Connect your own ElevenLabs account to generate sound
  effects and music from the chat. Each paid request waits for your approval.
- **Motion roles.** Every bundled component is tagged with its job: entry,
  emphasis, exit, scene or transition. The agent picks the one that fits the
  moment.

## The cast

You don't need an API key or a separate token bill. The studio drives the
command-line tool of a coding agent you already use, signed in with the
subscription you already pay for.

You don't have to memorize these. The studio shows the exact install and
sign-in commands for each agent and can open a Terminal window for you to paste
them into.

## It's real code, and it's yours

Every video is a standard Remotion project in a folder on your disk. You can
open it in your editor, commit it to git and take it anywhere. There's no
proprietary format and no lock-in.

```text

└── package.json                    remotion, pinned
```

## House rules

- **The agent stays in its folder.** File edits inside your project run
  without interrupting you. Any shell command, or any path outside the
  project, gets a permission card first. You choose the mode (auto, accept
  edits or plan), and there's no mode that bypasses the cards.
- **Nothing leaves your Mac without your consent.** There's no telemetry, and
  crash reports are opt-in.
- **Your agent setup stays untouched.** The studio brings its own skills to
  every agent and never writes into `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.copilot` or
  `~/.grok`.
- **Your project stays yours.** The studio writes into your project only what
  a turn or one of your own actions asked for.

## Requirements

- macOS on Apple silicon or Intel
- One of [the cast](#the-cast), installed and signed in on this Mac

The studio's environment checklist checks both, along with the project's
Remotion version and dependencies, and offers a fix for anything that's
missing.

## Behind the scenes

Want to build it yourself? You need macOS, [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.4 (the exact
version is pinned in `packageManager`), and the
[Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/): a Rust
toolchain and the Xcode Command Line Tools.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Remocn/remocn-studio.git
cd remocn-studio
bun install
cp .env.example .env   # optional: a Pexels key turns on stock photos
bun tauri dev
```

| Command                     | What it does                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bun run check`             | Format and lint in one read-only pass (what CI runs)                |
| `bun run fix`               | Apply the fixes `check` reports                                     |
| `bun run typecheck`         | `tsc --noEmit`                                                      |
| `bun run test`              | The test suite: bun test, happy-dom, Testing Library                |
| `bun run smoke:render`      | Run the real renderer against a fixture project (slow, needs network) |
| `bun tauri build --no-sign` | A local `.app` you can run but not release                          |

The studio has three layers. A **Tauri v2** core in Rust owns the window,
the keychain and the updater. The webview is a **Next.js** static export. A
**bun sidecar** built on Effect runs the agents, the history, the preview host
and the renderer. The map of the system and the working rules are in
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md).

## Contributing

Bug reports, fixes and ideas are welcome. Start with
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). It covers setting up, the checks CI
runs, and what a pull request needs.

What the studio does is specified in [`openspec/specs`](openspec/specs): one
spec per capability, each written as requirements with scenarios. To change
behavior, open an OpenSpec change. To ship it, record it with
`bun run changeset`. The reasoning behind each area, including the
measurements and the failed attempts, is in [`docs/decisions`](docs/decisions).
