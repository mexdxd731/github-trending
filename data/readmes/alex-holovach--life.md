# Life

Personal health telemetry, stored on your own server. Life connects directly to a
WHOOP 4.0 over Bluetooth, buffers readings on your iPhone, and uploads over Tailscale
to a backend with Prometheus and Grafana. No WHOOP account or subscription is required.

The Grafana screenshot shows an earlier UI prototype with placeholder HRV, strain,
and sleep scores. Current app and dashboard scores use recorded data.

## Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    strap["WHOOP 4.0"] <-->|Bluetooth LE| phone["Life on iPhone<br/>CoreBluetooth · SQLite · SwiftUI"]
    phone <-->|"Background uploads and result queries<br/>HTTPS"| api
    subgraph backend["Backend"]
        api["Gateway + ingestion API"] <--> storage[("Compressed archive + SQLite")]
        storage -->|Numeric outbox| worker["Remote-write worker"]
        storage <--> analysis["Scheduled analysis<br/>HRV · breathing · strain · sleep"]
        worker -->|Remote write| prometheus[("Prometheus")]
        api -->|Scraped analysis metrics| prometheus
        prometheus --> grafana["Grafana"]
    end
```

The phone saves history before acknowledging it to the strap. The backend saves each
upload before acknowledging it to the phone; Prometheus export happens separately.
Original packets remain archived for later decoding. [Bluetooth flow and packet layouts](docs/BLUETOOTH.md).

## Feature parity

Life covers part of the WHOOP 4.0 app's functionality. **Available** means implemented,
not equivalent physiological accuracy or the same scoring algorithm.

| Feature | Life | Implementation / difference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Live heart rate and history | Available | Local charts, automatic reconnection and stored-history backfill. |
| Battery | Available | Standard and custom readings must agree before publication. |
| HRV | Partial | Five-minute PPG RMSSD; whole-night summaries need sufficient qualifying coverage. |
| Skin temperature | Available | Wrist temperature and a baseline from prior logged nights; not core temperature. |
| Blood oxygen / SpO₂ | Partial | Device-calculated values; missing, error and ambiguous `98` results are withheld. |
| Respiratory rate | Experimental | Estimated from qualifying pulse timing. No device-calculated breathing field identified. |
| Strain | Custom | Recorded cardiovascular load mapped to Life's own 0–21 scale; no muscular strain. |
| Sleep | Manual | Editable bedtime/wake history and duration / chosen target; no automatic detection or stages. |
| Resting heart rate | Partial | Median heart rate during logged sleep; not WHOOP's RHR algorithm. |
| Recovery, stress, steps, calories, workout detection, haptic alarm | Not implemented | No substitute scores or automatic classifications. |
| Private storage and dashboards | Available | Local archive, Prometheus, Grafana and authenticated result APIs. |

See [scoring methods](docs/SCORING.md) and [comparison scope and sources](docs/BLUETOOTH.md#feature-comparison-scope).

## Signals we decode

| Signal | Source | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Heart rate and contact flags | Standard BLE Heart Rate Measurement; HR also in R24 history | Live charts and timestamped HR metrics; live contact flags and zero-HR checks filter invalid readings. |
| Battery percentage | Standard BLE Battery Level + custom battery response | Cross-checked battery metric. |
| Ordered pulse intervals | R24 history, up to four millisecond intervals per record | Inputs to HRV and respiratory analysis; raw words remain archived. |
| Wrist temperature | R24 signed word at byte `76`, divided by `10` | Firmware-gated °C reading and overnight baseline. |
| SpO₂ result / status | R24 byte `86` | Firmware-gated oxygen value with explicit invalid-code handling. |
| Motion and optical channels | Candidate R10/R11/R21 research layouts | Raw counts only; axes, wavelengths, scaling and accuracy remain unvalidated. |
| Events, commands, unknown fields and R25 history | Custom BLE notifications | Archived for research; unknown bytes do not become health metrics. |

Firmware-derived temperature, oxygen and interval interpretations currently target
**WHOOP 4.0 / Harvard 41.17.4.0**. Standard live BLE interval words are preserved but
are not used for HRV because their units and continuity remain unverified.

## Run the backend

Use a Linux server with Docker, Docker Compose, Python 3, and Tailscale installed.
Clone this repository into a persistent directory, then run:

```sh
cd life
./life setup
sh scripts/bootstrap_pc.sh
```

The bootstrap enables Docker at boot and configures Docker group access and the
Tailscale operator. Open a new terminal or SSH session afterward, then run:

```sh
./life start
./life expose
./life status
```

`./life start` starts the backend, analysis, Prometheus, Grafana and any additional
integrations. Services restart after a reboot once Docker is running. Data lives in
`data/`; credentials and machine settings stay out of Git.

Grafana is available at your private Tailscale URL. Its initial username is `admin`
(configurable in `.env`), with the password in `secrets/grafana_password`.
The iPhone endpoint is `https://YOUR-TAILSCALE-HOST/v1/batches`, using the token in
`secrets/ingest_token`.

Use `./life logs`, `./life stop`, and `./life backup` for routine operations.

## Build the iPhone app

Requires full Xcode, XcodeGen, and an iPhone running iOS 17 or later.

```sh
cp Config/Local.xcconfig.example Config/Local.xcconfig
# Set your bundle identifier and signing team in Config/Local.xcconfig.
xcodegen generate
open Life.xcodeproj
```

Enable Developer Mode on your iPhone and run the **Life** scheme. Enter the backend
URL and token in Settings, then connect your WHOOP. Set your maximum heart rate and
sleep target under **Strain & sleep → Set up**.

Keep the same bundle identifier when updating an existing installation. iOS controls
background execution; reopen Life after force-quitting it.

## Development

```sh
swift test
swift run CoreChecks
python3 scripts/check_backend.py
```

Additional integrations live under `integrations/<name>/compose.yaml` and join the
same `./life start` command. WHOOP 4.0 is the only implemented device integration.
