## Real TradingView Interface — Multi-Chart Layouts

![Official TradingView multi-chart layout selector](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/43584624330/original/FoE3ZB4ZQZfZ02dAEqNgA-6mv6O6MO-t1g.png?1759767326=)

TradingView Premium currently supports **up to 8 charts per tab**. Multi-chart layouts can be used to monitor different symbols, intervals, or analytical views inside one workspace.

TradingView also provides synchronization controls for symbol, interval, crosshair, time, date range, and drawings where supported.

![Official TradingView synchronized multi-chart interface](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/43584624805/original/53XsJsQT_bh1vtDtvzY6dtJM6hiOVS84SQ.png?1759767444=)

### Example workspace

```text
Chart 1  BTCUSD     1H     Trend / structure
Chart 2  BTCUSD     15m    Entry timing
Chart 3  ETHUSD     1H     Relative strength
Chart 4  SPX        1D     Risk context
Chart 5  DXY        4H     Dollar context
Chart 6  EURUSD     1H     FX correlation
Chart 7  GOLD       4H     Macro confirmation
Chart 8  TOTAL3     1D     Alt-market breadth
```

## Advanced Alerts

TradingView's current Premium plan provides **400 active price alerts + 400 active technical alerts**. Premium also supports open-ended alerts, which can remain active without a normal expiration date subject to TradingView's inactivity rules.

![Official TradingView alert configuration interface](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/43629651670/original/BCq8nckWl-2vNfHQmv8T44mNfnARaVQUzA.png?1782309073=)

Alerts can be based on:

- price movement;
- indicators;
- strategies;
- drawings;
- chart patterns;
- custom Pine conditions;
- multiple conditions in one alert;
- watchlists where supported.

### Alert workspace idea

```text
Breakout Alerts
Trend Confirmation
RSI / Momentum
Moving Average Crosses
Volatility Events
Strategy Orders
Macro Watchlist
Crypto Watchlist
```

---

## Watchlist Alerts

Premium currently includes **2 watchlist alerts**. A watchlist alert applies one selected condition across symbols in a list and tracks each symbol independently.

![Official TradingView watchlist alert workflow](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/43629675007/original/9FsROBYLgNuxzTLMjTUY_b13eOMLSVkX3A.png?1782314011=)

This is useful for setups such as:

```text
S&P 500 — daily breakout
Crypto majors — volatility expansion
FX majors — moving-average cross
Earnings watchlist — price threshold
Custom momentum basket
```

---

## Indicators & Technical Analysis

Premium currently allows **25 indicators per chart**. This gives enough room for complex analysis without combining unrelated tools into one script purely to stay under a low indicator limit.

A clean setup might separate indicators by function:

```text
Trend      EMA / SMA / Supertrend
Momentum   RSI / Stochastic / MACD
Volume     Volume Profile / Volume
Volatility ATR / Bollinger Bands
Structure  Pivots / custom Pine tools
Breadth    Market-specific breadth indicators
```

The repository recommends keeping layouts readable rather than using all 25 slots simply because they are available.

---

## Screeners

TradingView provides screeners for multiple asset classes. A Premium-centered workflow can use screeners for discovery and Supercharts for confirmation.

Suggested saved screens:

```text
High Relative Volume
52-Week Breakouts
Oversold Large Caps
Momentum Continuation
High Beta Movers
Dividend Quality
Crypto Trend Leaders
Forex Volatility
```

The current TradingView Screener also includes newer tools such as candlestick-pattern scanning, and TradingView introduced an AI Screener in public beta for paid plans in August 2026.

## Strategy Tester & Deep Backtesting

TradingView's **Deep Backtesting** is available to Premium users and professional plans. TradingView states that it can test Pine strategies across deeper historical data than regular chart testing, with up to **2 million bars** available for deep backtests.

![Official TradingView Deep Backtesting image](https://tvblog-static.tradingview.com/uploads/2022/06/deep-backtesting-preview-800x400.png)

Typical workflow:

```text
1. Open a strategy in Pine / Supercharts
2. Verify normal Strategy Tester behavior
3. Choose Deep Backtesting
4. Select the historical period
5. Generate the report
6. Review profitability, drawdown and trade statistics
7. Validate on an out-of-sample period
```

> Historical strategy performance does not guarantee future results.

## Chart Data Export

Chart data export is included in the Premium feature set. A research workflow can export data for additional offline analysis in Python, Excel, R, or a private research notebook.

Example organization:

```text
exports/
├── BTCUSD-1H.csv
├── ETHUSD-1H.csv
├── SPX-1D.csv
└── EURUSD-4H.csv
```
